1,VAST,TVCG,Other,FlowSense: A Natural Language Interface for Visual Data Exploration within a Dataflow System,"Bowen Yu, Claudio T. Silva",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.00681.pdf,"Dataflow visualization systems enable flexible visual data exploration by allowing the user to construct a dataflow diagram that composes query and visualization modules to specify system functionality. However learning dataflow diagram usage presents overhead that often discourages the user. In this work we design FlowSense, a natural language interface for dataflow visualization systems that utilizes state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques to assist dataflow diagram construction. FlowSense employs a semantic parser with special utterance tagging and special utterance placeholders to generalize to different datasets and dataflow diagrams. It explicitly presents recognized dataset and diagram special utterances to the user for dataflow context awareness. With FlowSense the user can expand and adjust dataflow diagrams more conveniently via plain English. We apply FlowSense to the VisFlow subset-flow visualization system to enhance its usability. We evaluate FlowSense by one case study with domain experts on a real-world data analysis problem and a formal user study.",,,,,https://github.com/yubowenok/flowsense,vimeo 360154533,10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934668,2019,2019,Ballroom ABC,Tuesday,VIS Best Paper Awards,22-Oct,10:00 AM,10:15 AM
2,InfoVis,TVCG,Other,Data Changes Everything: Challenges and Opportunities in Data Visualization Design Handoff,"Jagoda Walny, Christian Frisson, Mieka West, Doris Kosminsky, Søren Knudsen, Sheelagh Carpendale, Wesley Willett",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.00192.pdf,"Complex data visualization design projects often entail collaboration between people with different visualization-related skills. For example, many teams include both designers who create new visualization designs and developers who implement the resulting visualization software. We identify gaps between data characterization tools, visualization design tools, and development platforms that pose challenges for designer-developer teams working to create new data visualizations. While it is common for commercial interaction design tools to support collaboration between designers and developers, creating data visualizations poses several unique challenges that are not supported by current tools. In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values. In larger teams, designers must also clearly communicate these mappings and their dependencies to developers, clients, and other collaborators. We report observations and reflections from five large multidisciplinary visualization design projects and highlight six data-specific visualization challenges for design specification and handoff. These challenges include adapting to changing data, anticipating edge cases in data, understanding technical challenges, articulating data-dependent interactions, communicating data mappings, and preserving the integrity of data mappings across iterations. Based on these observations, we identify opportunities for future tools for prototyping, testing, and communicating data-driven designs, which might contribute to more successful and collaborative data visualization design.",,,,,,vimeo 360483702,10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934538,2019,2019,Ballroom ABC,Tuesday,VIS Best Paper Awards,22-Oct,10:15 AM,10:30 AM

Nashed, Tom Peterka",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.00407.pdf,"We propose InSituNet, a deep learning based surrogate model to support parameter space exploration for ensemble simulations that are visualized in situ. In situ visualization, generating visualizations at simulation time, is becoming prevalent in handling large-scale simulations because of the I/O and storage constraints. However, in situ visualization approaches limit the flexibility of post-hoc exploration because the raw simulation data are no longer available. Although multiple image-based approaches have been proposed to mitigate this limitation, those approaches lack the ability to explore the simulation parameters. Our approach allows flexible exploration of parameter space for large-scale ensemble simulations by taking advantage of the recent advances in deep learning. Specifically, we design InSituNet as a convolutional regression model to learn the mapping from the simulation and visualization parameters to the visualization results. With the trained model, users can generate new images for different simulation parameters under various visualization settings, which enables in-depth analysis of the underlying ensemble simulations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of InSituNet in combustion, cosmology, and ocean simulations through quantitative and qualitative evaluations.",,,,,,vimeo 359998980,10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934312,2019,2019,Ballroom ABC,Tuesday,VIS Best Paper Awards,22-Oct,10:30 AM,10:45 AM

However, these simulation models tend to be computationally very expensive and involve a large number of simulation input parameters, which need to be analyzed and properly calibrated before the models can be applied for real scientific studies. We propose a visual analysis system to facilitate interactive exploratory analysis of high-dimensional input parameter space for a complex yeast cell polarization simulation. The proposed system can assist the computational biologists, who designed the simulation model, to visually calibrate the input parameters by modifying the parameter values and immediately visualizing the predicted simulation outcome without having the need to run the original expensive simulation for every instance. Our proposed visual analysis system is driven by a trained neural network-based surrogate model as the backend analysis framework. In this work, we demonstrate the advantage of using neural networks as surrogate models for visual analysis by incorporating some of the recent advances in the field of uncertainty quantification, interpretability and explainability of neural network-based models. We utilize the trained network to perform interactive parameter sensitivity analysis of the original simulation as well as recommend optimal parameter configurations using the activation maximization framework of neural networks. We also facilitate detail analysis of the trained network to extract useful insights about the simulation model, learned by the network, during the training process. We performed two case studies, and discovered multiple new parameter configurations, which can trigger high cell polarization results in the original simulation model. We evaluated our results by comparing with the original simulation model outcomes as well as the findings from previous parameter analysis performed by our experts.",,,,,,vimeo 360155766,10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934591,2019,2019,Ballroom A,Tuesday,A Tour of VAST,22-Oct,2:35 PM,2:50 PM

However, to interpret the DR result for gaining useful insights from the data, it would take additional analysis effort such as identifying clusters and understanding their characteristics. While there are many automatic methods (e.g., density-based clustering methods) to identify clusters, effective methods for understanding a cluster’s characteristics are still lacking. A cluster can be mostly characterized by its distribution of feature values. Reviewing the original feature values is not a straightforward task when the number of features is large. To address this challenge, we present a visual analytics method that effectively highlights the essential features of a cluster in a DR result. To extract the essential features, we introduce an enhanced usage of contrastive principal component analysis (cPCA). Our method, called ccPCA (contrasting clusters in PCA), can calculate each feature’s relative contribution to the contrast between one cluster and other clusters. With ccPCA, we have created an interactive system including a scalable visualization of clusters’ feature contributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and system with case studies using several publicly available datasets.",,,,,,vimeo 360484919,10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934251,2019,2019,Ballroom A,Tuesday,A Tour of VAST,22-Oct,2:50 PM,3:05 PM

They come from various domains and often need to explore diverse sets of hypotheses and theories, a variety of data sources, algorithms, methods, tools, and visual designs. Taken together, we call these alternatives. To better understand and characterize the role of alternatives in their analyses, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 data workers with different types of expertise. We conducted four types of analyses to understand 1) why data workers explore alternatives; 2) the different notions of alternatives and how they fit into the sensemaking process; 3) the high-level processes around alternatives; and 4) their strategies to generate, explore, and manage those alternatives. We find that participants’ diverse levels of domain and computational expertise, experience with different tools, and collaboration within their broader context play an important role in how they explore these alternatives. These findings call out the need for more attention towards a deeper understanding of alternatives and the need for better tools to facilitate the exploration, interpretation, and management of alternatives. Drawing upon these analyses and findings, we present a framework based on participants’ 1) degree of attention, 2) abstraction level, and 3) analytic processes. We show how this framework can help understand how data workers consider such alternatives in their analyses and how tool designers might create tools to better support them.",,,,,,vimeo 360155794,10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934593,2019,2019,Ballroom A,Tuesday,A Tour of VAST,22-Oct,3:20 PM,3:35 PM

Making decisions based on such systems; however, requires an in-depth understanding of user behaviour both at an individual and at a group level where a group can consist of users with similar roles. We present a visual analytics approach to help analysts gain a comprehensive, multifaceted understanding of user behaviour at multiple levels. We take a user-centred approach to design a visual analytics framework supporting the analysis of collections of users and the numerous sessions of activities they conduct within digital applications. The framework is centred around the concept of hierarchical user profiles, where the profiles are built based on features derived from sessions they perform and visualised with task-informed designs to facilitate interactive exploration and investigation. We also present techniques to extract user tasks that summarise the behaviour and to cluster users according to these tasks to construct hierarchical user profiles. We externalise a series of analysis goals and tasks, and evaluate our methods through use cases conducted with experts. We observe that with the aid of interactive visual hierarchical user profiles, analysts were able to conduct exploratory and investigative analysis effectively, and able to understand the characteristics of user behaviour to make informed decisions whilst evaluating suspicious users and activities.",,,,,,vimeo 360156177,,2019,2019,Ballroom A,Tuesday,A Tour of VAST,22-Oct,3:35 PM,3:50 PM

From this interpretivist position we explore the nature of visualization design study and develop six criteria for rigor. We propose that rigor is established and judged according to the extent to which visualization design study research and its reporting are INFORMED , REFLEXIVE , ABUNDANT , PLAUSIBLE , RESONANT, and TRANSPARENT. This perspective and the criteria were constructed through a four-year engagement with the discourse around rigor and the nature of knowledge in social science, information systems, and design. We suggest methods from cognate disciplines that can support visualization researchers in meeting these criteria during the planning, execution, and reporting of design study. Through a series of deliberately provocative questions, we explore implications of this new perspective for design study research in visualization, concluding that as a discipline, visualization is not yet well positioned to embrace, nurture, and fully benefit from a rigorous, interpretivist approach to design study. The perspective and criteria we present are intended to stimulate dialogue and debate around the nature of visualization design study and the broader underpinnings of the discipline.",,,,,,vimeo 361976920,,2019,2019,Ballroom B,Tuesday,Provocations,22-Oct,2:35 PM,2:50 PM
11,InfoVis,TVCG,InfoVis,Data by proxy – material traces as autographic visualizations,Dietmar Offenhuber,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05454.pdf,"Information visualization limits itself, per definition, to the domain of symbolic information. This paper discusses arguments why the field should also consider forms of data that are not symbolically encoded, including physical traces and material indicators. Continuing a provocation presented by Pat Hanrahan in his 2004 IEEE Vis capstone address, this paper compares physical traces to visualizations and describes the techniques and visual practices for producing, revealing, and interpreting them. By contrasting information visualization with a speculative counter model of autographic visualization, this paper examines the design principles for material data. Autographic visualization addresses limitations of information visualization, such as the inability to directly reflect the material circumstances of data generation. The comparison between the two models allows probing the epistemic assumptions behind information visualization and uncovers linkages with the rich history of scientific visualization and trace reading. The paper begins by discussing the gap between data visualizations and their corresponding phenomena and proceeds by investigating how material visualizations can bridge this gap. It contextualizes autographic visualization with paradigms such as data physicalization and indexical visualization and grounds it in the broader theoretical literature of semiotics, science and technology studies (STS), and the history of scientific representation. The main section of the paper proposes a foundational design vocabulary for autographic visualization and offers examples of how citizen scientists already use autographic principles in their displays, which seem to violate the canonical principles of information visualization but succeed at fulfilling other rhetorical purposes in evidence construction. The paper concludes with a discussion of the limitations of autographic visualization, a roadmap for the empirical investigation of trace perception, and thoughts about how information visualization and autographic visualization techniques can contribute to each other",,,,,,vimeo 360050094,,2019,2019,Ballroom B,Tuesday,Provocations,22-Oct,2:50 PM,3:05 PM

In this paper we introduce and define a new methodological paradigm we call design by immersion, which provides an alternative perspective on problem-driven visualization work. Design by immersion embeds transdisciplinary experiences at the center of the visualization process by having visualization researchers participate in the work of the target domain (or domain experts participate in visualization research). Based on our own combined experiences of working on cross-disciplinary, problemdriven visualization projects, we present six case studies that expose the opportunities that design by immersion enables, including (1) exploring new domain-inspired visualization design spaces, (2) enriching domain understanding through personal experiences, and (3) building strong transdisciplinary relationships. Furthermore, we illustrate how the process of design by immersion opens up a diverse set of design activities that can be combined in different ways depending on the type of collaboration, project, and goals. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential pitfalls of design by immersion.",,,,,,vimeo 360483922,,2019,2019,Ballroom B,Tuesday,Provocations,22-Oct,3:05 PM,3:20 PM

We argue that this confusion is due to a lack of consensual definition. To tackle this problem, we start by synthesizing an inclusive view of interaction in the visualization community – including insights from information visualization, visual analytics and scientific visualization, as well as the input of both senior and junior visualization researchers. Once this view takes shape, we look at how interaction is defined in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). By extracting commonalities and differences between the views of interaction in visualization and in HCI, we synthesize a definition of interaction for visualization. Our definition is meant to be a thinking tool and inspire novel and bolder interaction design practices. We hope that by better understanding what interaction in visualization is and what it can be, we will enrich the quality of interaction in visualization systems and empower those who use them.",,,,https://osf.io/ej7xg,,vimeo 360445743,10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934283,2019,2019,Ballroom B,Tuesday,Provocations,22-Oct,3:20 PM,3:35 PM

This work considers, Why do so many visualization authors choose not to visualize uncertainty? I contribute a detailed characterization of practices, associations, and attitudes related to uncertainty communication among visualization authors, derived from the results of surveying 90 authors who regularly create visualizations for others as part of their work, and interviewing thirteen influential visualization designers. My results highlight challenges that authors face and expose assumptions and inconsistencies in beliefs about the role of uncertainty in visualization. In particular, a clear contradiction arises between authors’ acknowledgment of the value of depicting uncertainty and the norm of omitting direct depiction of uncertainty. To help explain this contradiction, I present a rhetorical model of uncertainty omission in visualization-based communication. I also adapt a formal statistical model of how viewers judge the strength of a signal in a visualization to visualization-based communication, to argue that uncertainty communication necessarily reduces degrees of freedom in viewers’ statistical inferences. I conclude with recommendations for how visualization research on uncertainty communication could better serve practitioners’ current needs and values while deepening understanding of assumptions that reinforce uncertainty omission.",,,,,,vimeo 360050405,10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934287,2019,2019,Ballroom B,Tuesday,Provocations,22-Oct,3:35 PM,3:50 PM

16,SciVis,TVCG,SciVis,Progressive Wasserstein Barycenters of Persistence Diagrams,"Jules Vidal, Joseph Budin, Julien Tierny",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.04565.pdf,"This paper presents an efficient algorithm for the progressive approximation of Wasserstein barycenters of persistence diagrams, with applications to the visual analysis of ensemble data. Given a set of scalar fields, our approach enables the computation of a persistence diagram which is representative of the set, and which visually conveys the number, data ranges and saliences of the main features of interest found in the set. Such representative diagrams are obtained by computing explicitly the discrete Wasserstein barycenter of the set of persistence diagrams, a notoriously computationally intensive task. In particular, we revisit efficient algorithms for Wasserstein distance approximation [12,51] to extend previous work on barycenter estimation [94]. We present a new fast algorithm, which progressively approximates the barycenter by iteratively increasing the computation accuracy as well as the number of persistent features in the output diagram. Such a progressivity drastically improves convergence in practice and allows to design an interruptible algorithm, capable of respecting computation time constraints. This enables the approximation of Wasserstein barycenters within interactive times. We present an application to ensemble clustering where we revisit the k-means algorithm to exploit our barycenters and compute, within execution time constraints, meaningful clusters of ensemble data along with their barycenter diagram. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-life data sets report that our algorithm converges to barycenters that are qualitatively meaningful with regard to the applications, and quantitatively comparable to previous techniques, while offering an order of magnitude speedup when run until convergence (without time constraint). Our algorithm can be trivially parallelized to provide additional speedups in practice on standard workstations.

Levine, Mike Kirby",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07224.pdf,"High-order finite element methods (HO-FEM) are gaining popularity in the simulation community due to their success in solving complex flow dynamics. There is an increasing need to analyze the data produced as output by these simulations. Simultaneously, topological analysis tools are emerging as powerful methods for investigating simulation data. However, most of the current approaches to topological analysis have had limited application to HO-FEM simulation data for two reasons. First, the current topological tools are designed for linear data (polynomial degree one), but the polynomial degree of the data output by these simulations is typically higher (routinely up to polynomial degree six). Second, the simulation data and derived quantities of the simulation data have discontinuities at element boundaries, and these discontinuities do not match the input requirements for the topological tools. One solution to both issues is to transform the high-order data to achieve low-order, continuous inputs for topological analysis. Nevertheless, there has been little work evaluating the possible transformation choices and their downstream effect on the topological analysis. We perform an empirical study to evaluate two commonly used data transformation methodologies along with the recently introduced L-SIAC filter for processing high-order simulation data. Our results show diverse behaviors are possible.

A theory and process for ABR is presented to address three current needs: (i) designing better visualizations by making it possible for non-programmers to rapidly design and critique many alternative data-to-visual mappings; (ii) expanding the visual vocabulary used in scientific visualizations to depict increasingly complex multivariate data; (iii) bringing a more engaging, natural, and human-relatable handcrafted aesthetic to data visualization. New tools and algorithms to support ABR include front-end applets for constructing artifact-based colormaps, optimizing 3D scanned meshes for use in data visualization, and synthesizing textures from artifacts. These are complemented by an interactive rendering engine with custom algorithms and interfaces that demonstrate multiple new visual styles for depicting point, line, surface, and volume data. A within-the-research-team design study provides early evidence of the shift in visualization design processes that ABR is believed to enable when compared to traditional scientific visualization systems.

The data on which a network is based, however, is rarely collected in a form that suits the analysis process, making it necessary to create and reshape networks. Data wrangling is widely acknowledged to be a critical part of the data analysis pipeline, yet interactive network wrangling has received little attention in the visualization research community. In this paper, we discuss a set of operations that are important for wrangling network datasets and introduce a visual data wrangling tool, Origraph, that enables analysts to apply these operations to their datasets. Key operations include creating a network from source data such as tables, reshaping a network by introducing new node or edge classes, filtering nodes or edges, and deriving new node or edge attributes. Our tool, Origraph, enables analysts to execute these operations with little to no programming, and to immediately visualize the results. Origraph provides views to investigate the network model, a sample of the network, and node and edge attributes. In addition, we introduce interfaces designed to aid analysts in specifying arguments for sensible network wrangling operations. We demonstrate the usefulness of Origraph in two Use Cases: first, we investigate gender bias in the film industry, and then the influence of money on the political support for the war in Yemen.",https://origraph.github.io/,,,,https://github.com/origraph/origraph.github.io,vimeo 360154783,,2019,2019,Ballroom A,Wednesday,(De)Construction,23-Oct,3:35 PM,3:50 PM

In this paper, we build upon previous experimental research carried out on larger displays that assessed animated and non-animated variants of scatterplots. Incorporating similar experimental stimuli and tasks, we conducted an experiment where 96 crowdworker participants performed nine trend comparison tasks using their mobile phones. We found that those using a small multiples design consistently completed tasks in less time, albeit with slightly less confidence than those using an animated design. The accuracy results were more task-dependent, and we further interpret our results according to the characteristics of the individual tasks, with a specific focus on the trajectories of target and distractor data items in each task.

For instance, looking, for different countries, at the evolution of both the life expectancy at birth and the fertility rate will give an overview of their demographics. The choice of visual representation for such multivariate data is key to enabling analysts to extract patterns and trends. Prior work has compared geo-temporal visualization techniques for a single thematic variable that evolves over space and time, or for two variables at a specific point in time. But how effective visualization techniques are at communicating correlation between two variables that evolve over space and time remains to be investigated. We report on a study comparing three techniques that are representative of different strategies to visualize geo-temporal multivariate data: either juxtaposing all locations for a given time step, or juxtaposing all time steps for a given location; and encoding thematic attributes either using symbols overlaid on top of map features, or using visual channels of the map features themselves. Participants performed a series of tasks that required them to identify if two variables were correlated over time and if there was a pattern in their evolution. Tasks varied in granularity for both dimensions: time (all time steps, a subrange of steps, one step only) and space (all locations, locations in a subregion, one location only). Our results show that a visualization’s effectiveness depends strongly on the task to be carried out.

To fully utilize this spatio-temporal data, we need to integrate it with domain-relevant context meta-data.

Our visual approach introduces a novel visual metaphor, namely 1-D Space-Time Charts that enable the analysis of single points at a glance based on small multiples.

We focus on a further step in event analysis: discover temporal relationship patterns between event locations, i.e., repeated cases when there is a specific temporal relationship (same time, before, or after) between events occurring at two locations. This can provide important clues for understanding the formation and spreading mechanisms of events and interdependencies among spatial locations.

Not only are other encodings less precise than position, but they can also be prone to systematic biases (e.g., color category boundaries can distort perceived differences between hues). By comparison, position’s high level of precision may seem to protect it from such biases. In contrast, across three empirical studies, we show that while position may be a precise form of data encoding, it can also produce systematic biases in how values are visually encoded, at least for reports of average position across a short delay. In displays with a single line or a single set of bars, reports of average positions were significantly biased, such that line positions were underestimated and bar positions were overestimated. In displays with multiple data series (i.e., multiple lines and/or sets of bars), this systematic bias still persisted. We also observed an effect of “perceptual pull”, where the average position estimate for each series was ‘pulled’ toward the other. These findings suggest that, although position may still be the most precise form of visual data encoding, it can also be systematically biased.",,,,,,vimeo 360049835,10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934400,2019,2019,Ballroom C,Tuesday,Bias & Patterns,22-Oct,4:10 PM,4:25 PM

One approach to highlighting these relations is to explicitly encode the numeric differences (deltas) between data values. Because this approach removes the context of the individual data values, it is important to measure how much of a performance improvement it actually offers, especially across differences in encodings and tasks, to ensure that it is worth adding to a visualization design. Across 3 different tasks, we measured the increase in visual processing efficiency for judging the relations between pairs of data values, from when only the values were shown, to when the deltas between the values were explicitly encoded, across position and length visual feature encodings (and slope encodings in Experiments 1 & 2). In Experiment 1, the participant’s task was to locate a pair of data values with a given relation (e.g., Find the ‘small bar to the left of a tall bar’ pair) among pairs of the opposite relation, and we measured processing efficiency from the increase in response times as the number of pairs increased. In Experiment 2, the task was to judge which of two relation types was more prevalent in a briefly presented display of 10 data pairs (e.g., Are there more ‘small bar to the left of a tall bar’ pairs or more ‘tall bar to the left of a small bar’ pairs?). In the final experiment, the task was to estimate the average delta within a briefly presented display of 6 data pairs (e.g., What is the average bar height difference across all ‘small bar to the left of a tall bar’ pairs?). Across all three experiments, visual processing of relations between data value pairs was significantly better when directly encoded as deltas rather than implicitly between individual data points, and varied substantially depending on the task (improvement ranged from 25% to 95%). Considering the ubiquity of bar charts and dot plots, relation perception for individual data values is highly inefficient, and confirms the need for alternative designs that provide not only absolute values, but also direct encoding of critical relationships between those values.",,,,,,vimeo 360049981,,2019,2019,Ballroom C,Tuesday,Bias & Patterns,22-Oct,4:25 PM,4:40 PM

Participants were told one of multiple backstories about political events that affected public polling data, before viewing a graph that depicted those data. One pattern in the data was particularly visually salient to them given the backstory that they heard. They then predicted what naïve viewers would most visually salient on the visualization. They were strongly influenced by their own knowledge, despite explicit instructions to ignore it, predicting that others would find the same patterns to be most visually salient. This result reflects a psychological phenomenon known as the curse of knowledge, where an expert struggles to re-create the state of mind of a novice.

A common method used for scaling is to enlarge or shrink the entire scatterplot together with the inside points synchronously and proportionally. This process is called geometric scaling. However, geometric scaling of scatterplots may cause a perceptual bias, that is, the perceived and physical values of visual features may be dissociated with respect to geometric scaling. For example, if a scatterplot is projected from a laptop to a large projector screen, then observers may feel that the scatterplot shown on the projector has fewer points than that viewed on the laptop. This paper presents an evaluation study on the perceptual bias of visual features in scatterplots caused by geometric scaling. The study focuses on three fundamental visual features (i.e., numerosity, correlation, and cluster separation) and three hypotheses that are formulated on the basis of our experience. We carefully design three controlled experiments by using well-prepared synthetic data and recruit participants to complete the experiments on the basis of their subjective experience. With a detailed analysis of the experimental results, we obtain a set of instructive findings. First, geometric scaling causes a bias that has a linear relationship with the scale ratio. Second, no significant difference exists between the biases measured from normally and uniformly distributed scatterplots. Third, changing the point radius can correct the bias to a certain extent. These findings can be used to inspire the design decisions of scatterplots in various scenarios.",,,,,,vimeo 360154646,10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934208,2019,2019,Ballroom C,Tuesday,Bias & Patterns,22-Oct,5:10 PM,5:25 PM

Effective ramps use colors that are sufficiently discriminable, align well with the data, and are aesthetically pleasing. Designers rely on years of experience to create high-quality color ramps. However, it is challenging for novice visualization developers that lack this experience to craft effective ramps as most guidelines for constructing ramps are loosely defined qualitative heuristics that are often difficult to apply. Our goal is to enable visualization developers to readily create effective color encodings using a single seed color. We do this using an algorithmic approach that models designer practices by analyzing patterns in the structure of designer-crafted color ramps. We construct these models from a corpus of 222 expert-designed color ramps, and use the results to automatically generate ramps that mimic designer practices.

Efforts have been underway to optimize color palette design for semantic interpretablity, but this requires having good estimates of human color-concept associations. Obtaining these data from humans is costly, which motivates the need for automated methods. We developed and evaluated a new method for automatically estimating color-concept associations in a way that strongly correlates with human ratings. Building on prior studies using Google Images, our approach operates directly on Google Image search results without the need for humans in the loop. Specifically, we evaluated several methods for extracting raw pixel content of the images in order to best estimate color-concept associations obtained from human ratings. The most effective method extracted colors using a combination of cylindrical sectors and color categories in color space. We demonstrate that our approach can accurately estimate average human color-concept associations for different fruits using only a small set of images.

However, this trial-and-error process is often haphazard and time-consuming. To provide users with an intuitive way to navigate the layout design space, we present a technique to systematically visualize a graph in diverse layouts using deep generative models. We design an encoder-decoder architecture to learn a model from a collection of example layouts, where the encoder represents training examples in a latent space and the decoder produces layouts from the latent space. In particular, we train the model to construct a two-dimensional latent space for users to easily explore and generate various layouts. We demonstrate our approach through quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated layouts.

Our method is a generalization of traditional principal component analysis (PCA) to multivariate probability distributions. In comparison to non-linear methods, linear dimensionality reduction techniques have the advantage that the characteristics of such probability distributions remain intact after projection. We derive a representation of the PCA sample covariance matrix that respects potential uncertainty in each of the inputs, building the mathematical foundation of our new method: uncertainty-aware PCA. In addition to the accuracy and performance gained by our approach over sampling-based strategies, our formulation allows us to perform sensitivity analysis with regard to the uncertainty in the data. For this, we propose factor traces as a novel visualization that enables to better understand the influence of uncertainty on the chosen principal components. We provide multiple examples of our technique using real-world datasets. As a special case, we show how to propagate multivariate normal distributions through PCA in closed form.

In scalar field topology, graph-based topological descriptors such as merge trees, contour trees, and Reeb graphs are commonly used to characterize topological changes in the (sub)level sets of scalar fields. One of the biggest challenges and opportunities to advance topology-based visualization is to understand and incorporate uncertainty into such topological descriptors to effectively reason about their underlying data. In this paper, we study a structural average of a set of labeled merge trees and use it to encode uncertainty in data. Specifically, we compute a 1-center tree that minimizes its maximum distance to any other tree in the set under a well-defined metric called the interleaving distance. We provide heuristic strategies that compute structural averages of merge trees whose labels do not fully agree. We further provide an interactive visualization system that resembles a numerical calculator that takes as input a set of merge trees and outputs a tree as their structural average. We also highlight structural similarities between the input and the average and incorporate uncertainty information for visual exploration. We develop a novel measure of uncertainty, referred to as consistency, via a metric-space view of the input trees. Finally, we demonstrate an application of our framework through merge trees that arise from ensembles of scalar fields. Our work is the first to employ interleaving distances and consistency to study a global, mathematically rigorous, structural average of merge trees in the context of uncertainty visualization.",,,,,,vimeo 359998912,10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934242,2019,2019,Ballroom A,Thursday,Ensembles & Uncertainty,24-Oct,2:35 PM,2:50 PM

However, it is not feasible to experimentally verify more than only a very small subset of them. In this paper, we propose a novel multiscale visual drilldown approach that was designed in tight collaboration with proteomic experts, enabling a systematic exploration of the configuration space. Our approach takes advantage of the hierarchical structure of the data – from the whole ensemble of protein complex configurations to the individual configurations, their contact interfaces, and the interacting amino acids. Our new solution is based on interactively linked 2D and 3D views for individual hierarchy levels and at each level, we offer a set of selection and filtering operations enabling the user to narrow down the number of configurations that need to be manually scrutinized. Furthermore, we offer a dedicated filter interface, which provides the users with an overview of the applied filtering operations and enables them to examine their impact on the explored ensemble. This way, we maintain the history of the exploration process and thus enable the user to return to an earlier point of the exploration.

Ruginski, Sarah Creem-Regehr",https://osf.io/zj6tp/,"Cognitive science has established widely used and validated procedures for evaluating working memory in numerous applied domains, but surprisingly few studies have employed these methodologies to assess claims about the impacts of visualizations on working memory. The lack of information visualization research that uses validated procedures for measuring working memory may be due, in part, to the absence of cross-domain methodological guidance tailored explicitly to the unique needs of visualization research. This paper presents a set of clear, practical, and empirically validated methods for evaluating working memory during visualization tasks and provides readers with guidance in selecting an appropriate working memory evaluation paradigm. As a case study, we illustrate multiple methods for evaluating working memory in a visual-spatial aggregation task with geospatial data. The results show that the use of dual-task experimental designs (simultaneous performance of several tasks compared to single-task performance) and pupil dilation can reveal working memory demands associated with task difficulty and dual-tasking. In a dual-task experimental design, measures of task completion times and pupillometry revealed the working memory demands associated with both task difficulty and dual-tasking. Pupillometry demonstrated that participants’ pupils were significantly larger when they were completing a more difficult task and when multitasking. We propose that researchers interested in the relative differences in working memory between visualizations should consider a converging methods approach, where physiological measures and behavioral measures of working memory are employed to generate a rich evaluation of visualization effort.",,,https://osf.io/6u8em/,https://osf.io/6u8em/,https://osf.io/6u8em/,vimeo 360050392,10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934286,2019,2019,Ballroom A,Wednesday,Evaluation & Reproducibility,23-Oct,10:50 AM,11:05 AM

Since it is known that splat events have a substantial impact on the heat transfer between flow and immersed surfaces, we adapt a splat detection and visualization method to a turbine cascade simulation in this case study. Because splat events are small phenomena, we use a direct numerical simulation resolving the turbulence in the flow as the base of our analysis.

To represent the semantics, we apply probabilistic topic modeling. After extracting a set of topics and representing the texts by vectors of topic weights, we aggregate the data into a data cube with the dimensions corresponding to the set of topics, the set of spatial locations (e.g., regions), and the time divided into suitable intervals according to the scale of the planned analysis. Each cube cell corresponds to a combination (topic, location, time interval) and contains aggregate measures characterizing the subset of the texts concerning this topic and having the spatial and temporal references within these location and interval. Based on this structure, we systematically describe the space of analysis tasks on exploring the interrelationships among the three heterogeneous information facets, semantics, space, and time. We introduce the operations of projecting and slicing the cube, which are used to decompose complex tasks into simpler subtasks. We then present a design of a visual analytics system intended to support these subtasks. To reduce the complexity of the user interface, we apply the principles of structural, visual, and operational uniformity while respecting the specific properties of each facet. The aggregated data are represented in three parallel views corresponding to the three facets and providing different complementary perspectives on the data. The views have similar look-and-feel to the extent allowed by the facet specifics. Uniform interactive operations applicable to any view support establishing links between the facets. The uniformity principle is also applied in supporting the projecting and slicing operations on the data cube.

To make an object of interest stand out independently from a number of distractors, the underlying visual cue, e.g., color, has to be preattentive. In our prior work, we introduced Deadeye as an instantly recognizable highlighting technique that works by rendering the target object for one eye only. In contrast to prior approaches, Deadeye excels by not modifying any visual properties of the target. However, in the case of 2D visualizations, the method requires an additional setup to allow dichoptic presentation, which is a considerable drawback. As a follow-up to requests from the community, this paper explores Deadeye as a highlighting technique for 3D visualizations, because such stereoscopic scenarios support dichoptic presentation out of the box. Deadeye suppresses binocular disparities for the target object, so we cannot assume the applicability of our technique as a given fact. With this motivation, the paper presents quantitative evaluations of Deadeye in VR, including configurations with multiple heterogeneous distractors as an important robustness challenge. After confirming the preserved preattentiveness (all average accuracies above 90 %) under such real-world conditions, we explore VR volume rendering as an example application scenario for Deadeye.

Specifically, it is important to understand how quantitative measurements of employee achievements relate to supervisor expectations, what the main drivers of good performance are, and how to combine these complex and flexible performance evaluation metrics into an accurate portrayal of organizational performance in order to identify shortcomings and improve overall productivity. To facilitate this process, we summarize common organizational performance analyses into four visual exploration task categories. Additionally, we develop MetricsVis, a visual analytics system composed of multiple coordinated views to support the dynamic evaluation and comparison of individual, team, and organizational performance in public safety organizations. MetricsVis provides four primary visual components to expedite performance evaluation: (1) a priority adjustment view to support direct manipulation on evaluation metrics; (2) a reorderable performance matrix to demonstrate the details of individual employees; (3) a group performance view that highlights aggregate performance and individual contributions for each group; and (4) a projection view illustrating employees with similar specialties to facilitate shift assignments and training.

For example, one can break down the incoming and outgoing influences of a research lab by research topics. The Influence Flower uses a recent snapshot of Microsoft Academic Graph, consisting of 212 million authors, their 176 million publications, and 1.2 billion citations. An interactive web app, Influence Map, is constructed around this central metaphor for searching and curating visualisations. We also propose a visual comparison method that highlights change in influence patterns over time. We demonstrate through several case studies that the Influence Flower supports data-driven inquiries about the following: researchers’ careers over time; paper(s) and projects, including those with delayed recognition; the interdisciplinary profile of a research institution; and the shifting topical trends in conferences.

The abundant information on social media intensifies the competition of WeChat Public Official Articles (i.e., posts) for gaining user attention due to the zero-sum nature of attention. Therefore, only a small portion of information tends to become extremely popular while the rest remains unnoticed or quickly disappears. Such a typical “long-tail” phenomenon is very common in social media. Thus, recent years have witnessed a growing interest in predicting the future trend in the popularity of social media posts and understanding the factors that influence the popularity of the posts. Nevertheless, existing predictive models either rely on cumbersome feature engineering or sophisticated parameter tuning, which are difficult to understand and improve. In this paper, we study and enhance a point process-based model by incorporating visual reasoning to support communication between the users and the predictive model for a better prediction result. The proposed system supports users to uncover the working mechanism behind the model and improve the prediction accuracy accordingly based on the insights gained.

This process can be difficult and time consuming for professional designers, not to mention non-expert users, leading to the demand for automated infographics design. As a first step, we focus on timeline infographics, which have been widely used for centuries. We contribute an end-to-end approach that automatically extracts an extensible timeline template from a bitmap image. Our approach adopts a deconstruction and reconstruction paradigm. At the deconstruction stage, we propose a multi-task deep neural network that simultaneously parses two kinds of information from a bitmap timeline: 1) the global information, i.e., the representation, scale, layout, and orientation of the timeline, and 2) the local information, i.e., the location, category, and pixels of each visual element on the timeline. At the reconstruction stage, we propose a pipeline with three techniques, i.e., Non-Maximum Merging, Redundancy Recover, and DL GrabCut, to extract an extensible template from the infographic, by utilizing the deconstruction results. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we synthesize a timeline dataset (4296 images) and collect a real-world timeline dataset (393 images) from the Internet. We first report quantitative evaluation results of our approach over the two datasets. Then, we present examples of automatically extracted templates and timelines automatically generated based on these templates to qualitatively demonstrate the performance.

Findings and results of the analysis often need to be communicated to an audience that lacks visual analytics expertise. This requires analysis outcomes to be presented in simpler ways than that are typically used in visual analytics systems. However, not only analytical visualizations may be too complex for target audiences but also the information that needs to be presented. Analysis results may consist of multiple components, which may involve multiple heterogeneous facets. Hence, there exists a gap on the path from obtaining analysis findings to communicating them, within which two main challenges lie: information complexity and display complexity. We address this problem by proposing a general framework where data analysis and result presentation are linked by story synthesis, in which the analyst creates and organises story contents. Unlike previous research, where analytic findings are represented by stored display states, we treat findings as data constructs. We focus on selecting, assembling and organizing findings for further presentation rather than on tracking analysis history and enabling dual (i.e., explorative and communicative) use of data displays. In story synthesis, findings are selected, assembled, and arranged in meaningful layouts that take into account the structure of information and inherent properties of its components. We propose a workflow for applying the proposed conceptual framework in designing visual analytics systems and demonstrate the generality of the approach by applying it to two diverse domains, social media and movement analysis.",,,,,,vimeo 364568266,10.1109/TVCG.2018.2889054,?,2019,Ballroom C,Thursday,Infographics & Storytelling,24-Oct,3:35 PM,3:50 PM

From this data, many people might confidently state that a before-school breakfast program would lead to higher grades. This is a reasoning error, because correlation does not necessarily indicate causation – X and Y can be correlated without one directly causing the other. While this error is pervasive, its prevalence might be amplified or mitigated by the way that the data is presented to a viewer. Across three crowdsourced experiments, we examined whether how simple data relations are presented would mitigate this reasoning error. The first experiment tested examples similar to the breakfast-GPA relation, varying in the plausibility of the causal link. We asked participants to rate their level of agreement that the relation was correlated, which they rated appropriately as high. However, participants also expressed high agreement with a causal interpretation of the data. Levels of support for the causal interpretation were not equally strong across visualization types: causality ratings were highest for text descriptions and bar graphs, but weaker for scatter plots. But is this effect driven by bar graphs aggregating data into two groups or by the visual encoding type? We isolated data aggregation versus visual encoding type and examined their individual effect on perceived causality. Overall, different visualization designs afford different cognitive reasoning affordances across the same data. High levels of data aggregation by graphs tend to be associated with higher perceived causality in data. Participants perceived line and dot visual encodings as more causal than bar encodings. Our results demonstrate how some visualization designs trigger stronger causal links while choosing others can help mitigate unwarranted perceptions of causality.",,,,,,vimeo 360049821,10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934399,2019,2019,Ballroom B,Thursday,Interactive Machine Learning,24-Oct,2:20 PM,2:35 PM

In REMAP, the user explores the large and complex parameter space for neural network architectures using a combination of global inspection and local experimentation. Through a visual overview of a set of models, the user identifies interesting clusters of architectures. Based on their findings, the user can run ablation and variation experiments to identify the effects of adding, removing, or replacing layers in a given architecture and generate new models accordingly. They can also handcraft new models using a simple graphical interface. As a result, a model builder can build deep learning models quickly, efficiently, and without manual programming.

However, the queries are limited to the predefined binning schema of preprocessed data cubes. Such limitation hinders analysts flexible adjustment of visual specifications to investigate the implicit patterns in the data effectively. Particularly, RSATree enables arbitrary queries and flexible binning strategies by leveraging three schemes, namely, an R-tree-based space partitioning scheme to catch the data distribution, a locality-sensitive hashing technique to achieve locality-preserving random access to data items, and a summed area table scheme to support interactive query of aggregated values with a linear computational complexity.

Our technique visualizes annotated patterns too small to be identifiable at certain zoom levels using insets, i.e., magnified thumbnail views of the annotated pattern. Insets support users in searching, comparing, and contextualizing patterns, while reducing the amount of navigation needed. They are dynamically placed either within the viewport or along the boundary of the viewport to offer a compromise between locality and context preservation.

ScaleTrotter allows viewers to smoothly transition from the nucleus of a cell to the atomistic composition of the DNA, while bridging several orders of magnitude in scale. The challenges in creating an interactive visualization of genome data are fundamentally different in several ways from those in other domains like astronomy that require a multi-scale representation as well. First, genome data has intertwined scale levels—the DNA is an extremely long, connected molecule that manifests itself at all scale levels. Second, elements of the DNA do not disappear as one zooms out—instead the scale levels at which they are observed group these elements differently. Third, we have detailed information and thus geometry for the entire dataset and for all scale levels, posing a challenge for interactive visual exploration. Finally, the conceptual scale levels for genome data are close in scale space, requiring us to find ways to visually embed a smaller scale into a coarser one. We address these challenges by creating a new multi-scale visualization concept. We use a scale-dependent camera model that controls the visual embedding of the scales into their respective parents, the rendering of a subset of the scale hierarchy, and the location, size, and scope of the view. In traversing the scales, ScaleTrotter is roaming between 2D and 3D visual representations that are depicted in integrated visuals.

However, when data is a live streaming feed, conventional DR methods cannot be directly used because of their computational complexity and inability to preserve the projected data positions at previous time points. In addition, the problem becomes even more challenging when the dynamic data records have a varying number of dimensions as often found in real-world applications. This paper presents an incremental DR solution. We enhance an existing incremental PCA method in several ways to ensure its usability for visualizing streaming multidimensional data. First, we use geometric transformation and animation methods to help preserve a viewer’s mental map when visualizing the incremental results. Second, to handle data dimension variants, we use an optimization method to estimate the projected data positions, and also convey the resulting uncertainty in the visualization.

We introduce a novel lossy compression algorithm for multidimensional data over regular grids. It leverages the higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD), a generalization of the SVD to three dimensions and higher, together with bit-plane, run-length and arithmetic coding to compress the HOSVD transform coefficients. Our scheme degrades the data particularly smoothly and achieves lower mean squared error than other state-of-the-art algorithms at low-to-medium bit rates, as it is required in data archiving and management for visualization purposes.

Visual analytics tools increasingly play a key role in exploring and answering complex questions about these large datasets. However, many visualizations are not designed to concurrently visualize the large number of dimensions present in complex datasets (e.g. tens of thousands of distinct codes in an electronic health record system). This fact, combined with the ability of many visual analytics systems to enable rapid, ad-hoc specification of groups, or cohorts, of individuals based on a small subset of visualized dimensions, leads to the possibility of introducing selection bias–when the user creates a cohort based on a specified set of dimensions, differences across many other unseen dimensions may also be introduced. These unintended side effects may result in the cohort no longer being representative of the larger population intended to be studied, which can negatively affect the validity of subsequent analyses. We present techniques for selection bias tracking and visualization that can be incorporated into high-dimensional exploratory visual analytics systems, with a focus on medical data with existing data hierarchies. These techniques include: (1) tree-based cohort provenance and visualization, including a user-specified baseline cohort that all other cohorts are compared against, and visual encoding of cohort “drift”, which indicates where selection bias may have occurred, and (2) a set of visualizations, including a novel icicle-plot based visualization, to compare in detail the per-dimension differences between the baseline and a user-specified focus cohort.

These techniques generally display aggregate statistics computed over sets of event sequences that share common patterns. Such techniques are often hindered, however, by the high-dimensionality of many real-world event sequence datasets which can prevent effective aggregation. A common coping strategy for this challenge is to group event types together prior to visualization, as a pre-process, so that each group can be represented within an analysis as a single event type. However, computing these event groupings as a pre-process also places significant constraints on the analysis. This paper presents a new visual analytics approach for dynamic hierarchical dimension aggregation. The approach leverages a predefined hierarchy of dimensions to computationally quantify the informativeness, with respect to a measure of interest, of alternative levels of grouping within the hierarchy at runtime. This information is then interactively visualized, enabling users to dynamically explore the hierarchy to select the most appropriate level of grouping to use at any individual step within an analysis. Key contributions include an algorithm for interactively determining the most informative set of event groupings for a specific analysis context, and a scented scatter-plus-focus visualization design with an optimization-based layout algorithm that supports interactive hierarchical exploration of alternative event type groupings.

However, due to the high noise in the deluge of data, effectively determining semantically relevant information can be difficult, further complicated by the changing definition of relevancy by each end user for different events. The majority of existing methods for short text relevance classification fail to incorporate users’ knowledge into the classification process. Existing methods that incorporate interactive user feedback focus on historical datasets. Therefore, classifiers cannot be interactively retrained for specific events or user-dependent needs in real-time. This limits real-time situational awareness, as streaming data that is incorrectly classified cannot be corrected immediately, permitting the possibility for important incoming data to be incorrectly classified as well. We present a novel interactive learning framework to improve the classification process in which the user iteratively corrects the relevancy of tweets in real-time to train the classification model on-the-fly for immediate predictive improvements. We computationally evaluate our classification model adapted to learn at interactive rates. Our results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models. In addition, we integrate our framework with the extended Social Media Analytics and Reporting Toolkit (SMART) 2.0 system, allowing the use of our interactive learning framework within a visual analytics system tailored for real-time situational awareness.

With the advent of industry 4.0, plenty of data recording the status of factory resources have been collected and further involved in production planning, which brings an unprecedented opportunity to understand, evaluate and adjust complex production plans through a data-driven approach. However, developing a systematic analytics approach for production planning is challenging due to the large volume of production data, the complex dependency between products, and unexpected changes in the market and the plant. Previous studies only provide summarized results and fail to show details for comparative analysis of production plans. Besides, the rapid adjustment to the plan in the case of an unanticipated incident is also not supported. In this paper, we propose PlanningVis, a visual analytics system to support the exploration and comparison of production plans with three levels of details: a plan overview presenting the overall difference between plans, a product view visualizing various properties of individual products, and a production detail view displaying the product dependency and the daily production details in related factories. By integrating an automatic planning algorithm with interactive visual explorations, PlanningVis can facilitate the efficient optimization of daily production planning as well as support a quick response to unanticipated incidents in manufacturing.

Ideally, when the data changes, the visualization changes in perceptible ways. This relation breaks down when there is a mismatch between the encoding and the character of the dataset being viewed. Unfortunately, visualizations are often designed and evaluated without fully exploring how they will respond to a wide variety of datasets. We explore the use of an image similarity measure, the Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM), for testing the discriminability of a data visualization across a variety of datasets. MS-SSIM is able to capture the similarity of two visualizations across multiple scales, including low level granular changes and high level patterns. Significant data changes that are not captured by the MS-SSIM indicate visualizations of low discriminability and effectiveness. The measure’s utility is demonstrated with two empirical studies. In the first, we compare human similarity judgments and MS-SSIM scores for a collection of scatterplots. In the second, we compute the discriminability values for a set of basic visualizations and compare them with empirical measurements of effectiveness. In both cases, the analyses show that the computational measure is able to approximate empirical results.

Our study results reveal that ad-hoc sketch-only querying is not as commonly used as prior work suggests, since analysts are often unable to precisely express their patterns of interest. In addition, we characterize three essential sensemaking processes supported by our enhanced VQS.

For network analysts, we introduce a novel model space representation and two interaction techniques for a user-guided reordering of rows or columns, and especially groups thereof (submatrix reordering). These novel techniques contribute to the understanding of the global and local dataset topology. We support algorithm designers by giving them access to 16 reordering quality metrics and visual exploration means for comparing reordering implementations on a row/column permutation level. We evaluated GUIRO in a guided explorative user study with 12 subjects, a case study demonstrating its usefulness in a real-world scenario, and through an expert study gathering feedback on our design decisions. We found that our proposed methods help even inexperienced users to understand matrix patterns and allow a user-guided steering of reordering algorithms. GUIRO helps to increase the transparency of matrix reordering algorithms, thus helping a broad range of users to get a better insight into the complex reordering process, in turn supporting data and reordering algorithm insights.",,,,,,youtube kJ74LK4jvLM,10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934300,2019,2019,Ballroom A,Tuesday,VIS Meets Machine Learning,22-Oct,4:10 PM,4:25 PM

Prior researches on selection methods were developed mainly based on heuristics such as local point density, thus limiting their applicability in general data. Specific challenges root in the great variabilities implied by point clouds (e.g., dense vs. sparse), viewpoint (e.g., occluded vs. non-occluded), and lasso (e.g., small vs. large). In this work, we introduce LassoNet, a new deep neural network for lasso selection of 3D point clouds, attempting to learn a latent mapping from viewpoint and lasso to point cloud regions. To achieve this, we couple user-target points with viewpoint and lasso information through 3D coordinate transform and naive selection, and improve the method scalability via an intention filtering and farthest point sampling. A hierarchical network is trained using a dataset with over 30K lasso-selection records on two different point cloud data. We conduct a formal user study to compare LassoNet with two state-of-the-art lasso-selection methods. The evaluations confirm that our approach improves the selection effectiveness and efficiency across different combinations of 3D point clouds, viewpoints, and lasso selections.

Such images represent the cutting edge of digital histology and promise to revolutionize how diseases such as cancer are studied, diagnosed, and treated. Highly multiplexed tissue images are complex, comprising 10<sup>9</sup> or more pixels, 60-plus channels, and millions of individual cells. This makes manual analysis challenging and error-prone. Existing automated approaches are also inadequate, in large part, because they are unable to effectively exploit the deep knowledge of human tissue biology available to anatomic pathologists. To overcome these challenges, Facetto enables a semi-automated analysis of cell types and states. It integrates unsupervised and supervised learning into the image and feature exploration process and offers tools for analytical provenance. Experts can cluster the data to discover new types of cancer and immune cells and use clustering results to train a convolutional neural network that classifies new cells accordingly. Likewise, the output of classifiers can be clustered to discover aggregate patterns and phenotype subsets. We also introduce a new hierarchical approach to keep track of analysis steps and data subsets created by users; this assists in the identification of cell types. Users can build phenotype trees and interact with the resulting hierarchical structures of both high-dimensional feature and image spaces. We report on use-cases in which domain scientists explore various large-scale fluorescence imaging datasets.

Zamani, Liangge Hsu, Raymond Huang, Cody Dunne, Michelle A. Borkin",https://osf.io/63y5c/,"Blood circulation in the human brain is supplied through a network of cerebral arteries. If a clinician suspects a patient has a stroke or other cerebrovascular condition, they order imaging tests. Neuroradiologists visually search the resulting scans for abnormalities. Their visual search tasks correspond to the abstract network analysis tasks of browsing and path following. To assist neuroradiologists in identifying cerebral artery abnormalities, we designed CerebroVis, a novel abstract—yet spatially contextualized—cerebral artery network visualization. In this design study, we contribute a novel framing and definition of the cerebral artery system in terms of network theory and characterize neuroradiologist domain goals as abstract visualization and network analysis tasks. Through an iterative, user-centered design process we developed an abstract network layout technique which incorporates cerebral artery spatial context. The abstract visualization enables increased domain task performance over 3D geometry representations, while including spatial context helps preserve the user’s mental map of the underlying geometry. We provide open source implementations of our network layout technique and prototype cerebral artery visualization tool. We demonstrate the robustness of our technique by successfully laying out 61 open source brain scans. We evaluate the effectiveness of our layout through a mixed methods study with three neuroradiologists. In a formative controlled experiment our study participants used CerebroVis and a conventional 3D visualization to examine real cerebral artery imaging data to identify a simulated intracranial artery stenosis. Participants were more accurate at identifying stenoses using CerebroVis (absolute risk difference 13%).

To enable this type of analysis, we introduce a novel topology-based spatial similarity measure, T-SSIM, and a predictive algorithm based on this similarity measure.

Traditional 3D / 4D medical image reconstruction requires near hundreds of projections, which cost insufferable computational time and deliver undesirable high imaging / radiation dose to human subjects. Moreover, it always needs further notorious processes to segment or extract the accurate 3D organ models subsequently. The computational time and imaging dose can be reduced by decreasing the number of projections, but the reconstructed image quality is degraded accordingly. To our knowledge, there is no method directly and explicitly reconstructing multiple 3D organ meshes from a single 2D medical grayscale image on the fly. Given single-view 2D medical images, e.g., 3D / 4D-CT projections or X-ray images, our end-to-end DeepOrganNet framework can efficiently and effectively reconstruct 3D / 4D lung models with a variety of geometric shapes by learning the smooth deformation fields from multiple templates based on a trivariate tensor-product deformation technique, leveraging an informative latent descriptor extracted from input 2D images. The proposed method can guarantee to generate high-quality and high-fidelity manifold meshes for 3D / 4D lung models; while, all current deep learning based approaches on the shape reconstruction from a single image cannot. The major contributions of this work are to accurately reconstruct the 3D organ shapes from 2D single-view projection, significantly improve the procedure time to allow on-the-fly visualization, and dramatically reduce the imaging dose for human subjects. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional reconstruction method and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive 3D and 4D examples, including both synthetic phantom and real patient datasets. The efficiency of the proposed method shows that it only needs several milliseconds to generate organ meshes with 10K vertices, which has a great potential to be used in real-time image guided radiation therapy (IGRT).",,,,,,vimeo 359999320,,2019,2019,Ballroom A,Thursday,Visualization in Medicine,24-Oct,4:40 PM,4:55 PM

Nowadays, the coordination between the muscles to generate simple movements is still not well understood, hindering the knowledge of how to best treat patients with this type of peripheral nerve injury. To acquire enough information for medical data analysis, physicians conduct motion analysis assessments with patients to produce a rich dataset of electromyographic signals from multiple muscles recorded with joint movements during real-world tasks. However, tools for the analysis and visualization of the data in a succinct and interpretable manner are currently not available. Without the ability to integrate, compare, and compute multiple data sources in one platform, physicians can only compute simple statistical values to describe patient’s behavior vaguely, which limits the possibility to answer clinical questions and generate hypotheses for research. To address this challenge, we have developed MOTION BROWSER, an interactive visual analytics system which provides an efficient framework to extract and compare muscle activity patterns from the patient’s limbs and coordinated views to help users analyze muscle signals, motion data, and video information to address different tasks. The system was developed as a result of a collaborative endeavor between computer scientists and orthopedic surgery and rehabilitation physicians.

When such methods are applied to text in natural languages, the quality of the extracted topics are usually judged based on the semantic relatedness of the terms pertinent to the topics. This criterion, however, is not necessarily applicable to topics extracted from non-textual data, such as action sets, since relationships between actions may not be obvious. We have developed a suite of visual and interactive techniques supporting the construction of an appropriate combination of topics based on other criteria, such as distinctiveness and coverage of the behavior set.

These tasks are supported by an interactive visual analytics workspace that uses word-embedding projections to define concept regions which can then be refined. The user-refined concepts are independent of a particular document collection and can be transferred to related corpora. All user interactions within the concept space directly affect the semantic relations of the underlying vector space model, which, in turn, change the topic modeling. In addition to direct manipulation, our system guides the users’ decisionmaking process through recommended interactions that point out potential improvements.

However, understanding how neural networks produce final predictions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing work on interpreting neural network predictions for images often focuses on explaining predictions for single images or neurons. As predictions are often computed from millions of weights that are optimized over millions of images, such explanations can easily miss a bigger picture. We present SUMMIT, an interactive system that scalably and systematically summarizes and visualizes what features a deep learning model has learned and how those features interact to make predictions. SUMMIT introduces two new scalable summarization techniques: (1) activation aggregation discovers important neurons, and (2) neuron-influence aggregation identifies relationships among such neurons. SUMMIT combines these techniques to create the novel attribution graph that reveals and summarizes crucial neuron associations and substructures that contribute to a model’s outcomes. SUMMIT scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images, and leverages neural network feature visualization and dataset examples to help users distill large, complex neural network models into compact, interactive visualizations. We present neural network exploration scenarios where SUMMIT helps us discover multiple surprising insights into a prevalent, large-scale image classifier’s learned representations and informs future neural network architecture design. The SUMMIT visualization runs in modern web browsers and is open-sourced.",,,,,,vimeo 360154453,,2019,2019,Ballroom A,Thursday,XAI and Fairness,24-Oct,9:45 AM,10:00 AM

Despite the benefits algorithmic systems may bring, models can reflect, inject, or exacerbate implicit and explicit societal biases into their outputs, disadvantaging certain demographic subgroups. Discovering which biases a machine learning model has introduced is a great challenge, due to the numerous definitions of fairness and the large number of potentially impacted subgroups. We present FAIRVIS, a mixed-initiative visual analytics system that integrates a novel subgroup discovery technique for users to audit the fairness of machine learning models. Through FAIRVIS, users can apply domain knowledge to generate and investigate known subgroups, and explore suggested and similar subgroups. FAIRVIS’s coordinated views enable users to explore a high-level overview of subgroup performance and subsequently drill down into detailed investigation of specific subgroups. We show how FAIRVIS helps to discover biases in two real datasets used in predicting income and recidivism. As a visual analytics system devoted to discovering bias in machine learning, FAIRVIS demonstrates how interactive visualization may help data scientists and the general public understand and create more equitable algorithmic systems.",,,,,,vimeo 360155233,,2019,2019,Ballroom A,Thursday,XAI and Fairness,24-Oct,10:00 AM,10:15 AM

Without careful attention, and if PWD are not included as equal participants throughout the process, there is a danger of perpetuating a vision-first approach to accessible design that marginalizes the lived experience of disability (e.g., by creating overly simplistic “sensory translations” that map visual to non-visual modalities in a one-to-one fashion). In this paper, we present a set of sociotechnical considerations for research in accessible visualization design, drawing on literature in disability studies, tactile information systems, and participatory methods. We identify that using state-of-the-art technologies may introduce more barriers to access than they remove, and that expectations of research novelty may not produce outcomes well-aligned with the needs of disability communities. Instead, to promote a more inclusive design process, we emphasize the importance of clearly communicating goals, following existing accessibility guidelines, and treating PWD as equal participants who are compensated for their specialized skills. To illustrate how these considerations can be applied in practice, we discuss a case study of an inclusive design workshop held in collaboration with the Perkins School for the Blind.",,,,,,vimeo 363041501,,?,2019,Room 1,Tuesday,Short Papers: Novel Interfaces,22-Oct,2:55 PM,3:05 PM

Recently, they have been further evolved into an advanced approach called multi-head self-attention networks, which can encode a set of input vectors, e.g., word vectors in a sentence, into another set of vectors. Such encoding aims at simultaneously capturing diverse syntactic and semantic features within a set, each of which corresponds to a particular attention head, forming altogether multi-head attention. Meanwhile, the increased model complexity prevents users from easily understanding and manipulating the inner workings of models. To tackle the challenges, we present a visual analytics system called SANVis, which helps users understand the behaviors and the characteristics of multi-head self-attention networks.

However, they face a significant problem influencing the perception and interpretation of patterns. The distance between two parallel lines differs based on their slope. Vertical lines are rendered longer and closer to each other than horizontal lines. This problem is inherent in the technique and has two main consequences: (1) clusters which have a steep slope between two axes are visually more prominent than horizontal clusters. (2) Noise and clutter can be perceived as clusters, as a few parallel vertical lines visually emerge as a ghost cluster. Our paper makes two contributions: First, we formalize the problem and show its impact. Second, we present a novel technique to reduce the effects by rendering the polylines of the parallel coordinates based on their slope: horizontal lines are rendered with the default width, lines with a steep slope with a thinner line. Our technique avoids density distortions of clusters, can be computed in linear time, and can be added on top of most parallel coordinate variations.

While there is evidence that salient shapes support clustering tasks, evaluation, and direct comparison of data-driven ordering strategies has not received much research attention. We contribute an empirical user study to evaluate the efficiency, effectiveness, and user confidence in visual clustering tasks using star glyphs.

Visualization is often the first step in making sense of data, and a crucial part of building and debugging analysis pipelines. It is therefore important that visualizations can be quickly prototyped, as well as developed or embedded into full applications. In order to better judge spatiotemporal relationships, immersive hardware, such as Virtual or Augmented Reality (VR/AR) headsets and associated controllers are becoming invaluable tools. In this work we introduce scenery, a flexible VR/AR visualization framework for the Java VM that can handle mesh and large volumetric data, containing multiple views, timepoints, and color channels. scenery is free and open-source software, works on all major platforms, and uses the Vulkan or OpenGL rendering APIs. We introduce scenery’s main features and example applications, such as its use in VR for microscopy, in the biomedical image analysis software Fiji, or for visualising agent-based simulations.",,,,,,,,?,2019,Room 1,Thursday,"Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine",24-Oct,2:20 PM,2:30 PM

TempoCave provides a range of functionality to explore metrics related to the activity patterns and modular affiliations of different regions in the brain. These patterns are calculated by processing raw data retrieved functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, which creates a network of weighted edges between each brain region, where the weight indicates how likely these regions are to activate synchronously. In particular, we support the analysis needs of clinical psychologists, who examine these modular affiliations and weighted edges and their temporal dynamics, utilizing them to understand relationships between neurological disorders and brain activity, which could have significant impact on the way in which patients are diagnosed and treated. We summarize the core functionality of TempoCave, which supports a range of comparative tasks, and runs both in a desktop mode and in an immersive mode. Furthermore, we present a real world use case that analyzes pre- and post-treatment connectome datasets from 27 subjects in a clinical study investigating the use of cognitive behavior therapy to treat major depression disorder, indicating that TempoCave can provide new insight into the dynamic behavior of the human brain.",,,,,https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/TempoCave,vimeo 363456447,,?,2019,Room 1,Thursday,"Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine",24-Oct,3:00 PM,3:10 PM

These techniques often require researchers to engineer abstract “features” that encode chemical concepts into a mathematical form compatible with the input to machine-learning models.

We present ElectroLens, a new visualization tool for high-dimensional spatially-resolved features to tackle this problem. The tool visualizes high-dimensional data sets for atomistic and electron environment features by a series of linked 3D views and 2D plots.

Current visualization methods to explore event data focus on discovering sequential patterns but present limitations when studying time attributes in event sequences. Time attributes are especially important when studying waiting times or lengths of visit in patient flow analysis. We propose a visual analytics methodology that allows the identification of trends and outliers in respect of duration and time of occurrence in event sequences. The proposed method presents event data using a single Sequential and Time Patterns overview. User-driven alignment by multiple events, sorting by sequence similarity and a novel visual encoding of events allows the comparison of time trends across and within sequences. The proposed visualization allows the derivation of findings that otherwise could not be obtained using traditional visualizations.

Prior work has demonstrated the utility of using singleevent alignment for understanding the precursor, co-occurring, and aftereffect events surrounding a sentinel event. However, the usefulness of single-event alignment has not been sufficiently evaluated in composite visualizations. Furthermore, recently proposed dualevent alignment techniques have not been empirically evaluated. In this work, we designed tasks around temporal event sequence and timing analysis and conducted a controlled experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk to examine four sentinel event alignment approaches: no sentinel event alignment (NoAlign), single-event alignment (SingleAlign), dual-event alignment with left justification (DualLeft), and dual-event alignment with stretch justification (DualStretch). Differences between approaches were most pronounced with more rows of data. For understanding intermediate events between two sentinel events, dual-event alignment was the clear winner for correctness—71% vs. 18% for NoAlign and SingleAlign. For understanding the duration between two sentinel events, NoAlign was the clear winner: correctness—88% vs. 36% for DualStretch— completion time—55 seconds vs. 101 seconds for DualLeft—and error—1.5% vs. 8.4% for DualStretch. For understanding precursor and aftereffect events, there was no significant difference among approaches.

These tools allow data analysts to represent multidimensional data in a 2D or 3D space, while preserving as much relevant information as possible. Yet, they cannot preserve all structures simultaneously and they induce some unavoidable distortions. Hence, many criteria have been introduced to evaluate a map’s overall quality, mostly based on the preservation of neighbourhoods. Such global indicators are currently used to compare several maps, which helps to choose the most appropriate mapping method and its hyperparameters. However, those aggregated indicators tend to hide the local repartition of distortions. Thereby, they need to be supplemented by local evaluation to ensure correct interpretation of maps. In this paper, we describe a new method, called MING, for “Map Interpretation using Neighbourhood Graphs”. It offers a graphical interpretation of pairs of map quality indicators, as well as local evaluation of the distortions. This is done by displaying on the map the nearest neighbours graphs computed in the data space and in the embedding. Shared and unshared edges exhibit reliable and unreliable neighbourhood information conveyed by the mapping. By this mean, analysts may determine whether proximity (or remoteness) of points on the map faithfully represents similarity (or dissimilarity) of original data, within the meaning of a chosen map quality criteria. We apply this approach to two pairs of widespread indicators: precision/recall and trustworthiness/continuity, chosen for their wide use in the community, which will allow an easy handling by users.",,,,,,vimeo 363451896,,?,2019,Room 1,Thursday,"Multi-Dimensional Data, Time Series, Graphs, and Trees",24-Oct,4:10 PM,4:20 PM

We haveused multiple visual cues such as orientation, thickness, color, count-able glyphs, and text to depict cross-dimensional information. Wehave added interactivity and hierarchical browsing to facilitate flex-ible exploration of the display: small areas can be scrutinized fordetails. Thus, our method is also easily extendable to visualize hierarchical information. Our glyph animations add an engagingaesthetic during interaction.

Numerous extensions have been proposed to address integrity, scalability and readability. We make a new case to employ PC on conditional data, where additional dimensions are only unfolded if certain criteria are met in an observation. Compared to standard PC which operate on a flat set of dimensions the ontology of our input to Conditional Parallel Coordinates is of hierarchical nature. We therefore briefly review related work around hierarchical PC using aggregation or nesting techniques. Our contribution is a visualization to seamlessly adapt PC for conditional data under preservation of intuitive interaction patterns to select or highlight polylines.

Our visualization provides a unique way to navigate time series that involves a “vocabulary of patterns” developed by using a dimensionality reduction technique, Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX). With SAX, the time series data clusters efficiently and is quicker to query at scale.

In this paper, we propose a nonuniform timeslicing approach for dynamic graph visualization. Our goal is to create timeslices of equal visual complexity. To this end, we adapt histogram equalization to create timeslices with a similar number of events, balancing the visual complexity across timeslices and conveying more important details of timeslices with bursting edges.
