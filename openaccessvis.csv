TVCG,TVCG,Timelines Revisited: A Design Space and Considerations for Expressive Storytelling,"Matthew Brehmer, Bongshin Lee, Benjamin Bach, Nathalie Henry Riche, Tamara Munzner",http://www.aviz.fr/~bbach/timelines/Brehmer2016timelines.pdf,"There are many ways to visualize event sequences as timelines. In a storytelling context where the intent is to convey multiple narrative points, a richer set of timeline designs may be more appropriate than the narrow range that has been used for exploratory data analysis by the research community. Informed by a survey of 263 timelines, we present a design space for storytelling with timelines that balances expressiveness and effectiveness, identifying 14 design choices characterized by three dimensions: representation, scale, and layout. Twenty combinations of these choices are viable timeline designs that can be matched to different narrative points, while smooth animated transitions between narrative points allow for the presentation of a cohesive story, an important aspect of both interactive storytelling and data videos. We further validate this design space by realizing the full set of viable timeline designs and transitions in a proof-of-concept sandbox implementation that we used to produce seven example timeline stories. Ultimately, this work is intended to inform and inspire the design of future tools for storytelling with timelines.",https://timelinesrevisited.github.io/,http://timelinesrevisited.github.io/supplemental/,,video http://timelinesrevisited.github.io/supplemental/stories/routines.mp4,10.1109/TVCG.2016.2614803,2016,2017,InfoVis,301-D,Tuesday,Time and Space,5:15 PM,5:35 PM
TVCG,TVCG,A Survey on Visual Approaches for Analyzing Scientific Literature and Patents,"Paolo Federico, Florian Heimerl, Steffen Koch, Silvia Miksch",https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/PubDat_251231.pdf,"The increasingly large number of available writings describing technical and scientific progress, calls for advanced analytic tools for their efficient analysis. This is true for many application scenarios in science and industry and for different types of writings, comprising patents and scientific articles. Despite important differences between patents and scientific articles, both have a variety of common characteristics that lead to similar search and analysis tasks. However, the analysis and visualization of these documents is not a trivial task due to the complexity of the documents as well as the large number of possible relations between their multivariate attributes. In this survey, we review interactive analysis and visualization approaches of patents and scientific articles, ranging from exploration tools to sophisticated mining methods. In a bottom-up approach, we categorize them according to two aspects: (a) data type (text, citations, authors, metadata, and combinations thereof), and (b) task (finding and comparing single entities, seeking elementary relations, finding complex patterns, and in particular temporal patterns, and investigating connections between multiple behaviours). Finally, we identify challenges and research directions in this area that ask for future investigations.",http://ieg.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/~federico/LiPatVis/,,,vimeo 230834614,10.1109/TVCG.2016.2610422,2016,2017,VAST,207,Wednesday,Text Analytics,10:30 AM,10:50 AM

TVCG,TVCG,Revealing Patterns and Trends of Mass Mobility through Spatial and Temporal Abstraction of Origin-Destination Movement Data,"Gennady Andrienko, Natalia Andrienko, Georg Fuchs, Jo Wood",http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/15488/1/andrienko_revealing_2016_AuthorCopy.pdf,"Origin-destination (OD) movement data describe moves or trips between spatial locations by specifying the origins, destinations, start, and end times, but not the routes travelled. For studying the spatio-temporal patterns and trends of mass mobility, individual OD moves of many people are aggregated into flows (collective moves) by time intervals. Time-variant flow data pose two difficult challenges for visualization and analysis. First, flows may connect arbitrary locations (not only neighbors), thus making a graph with numerous edge intersections, which is hard to visualize in a comprehensible way. Even a single spatial situation consisting of flows in one time step is hard to explore. The second challenge is the need to analyze long time series consisting of numerous spatial situations. We present an approach facilitating exploration of long-term flow data by means of spatial and temporal abstraction. It involves a special way of data aggregation, which allows representing spatial situations by diagram maps instead of flow maps, thus reducing the intersections and occlusions pertaining to flow maps. The aggregated data are used for clustering of time intervals by similarity of the spatial situations. Temporal and spatial displays of the clustering results facilitate the discovery of periodic patterns and longer-term trends in the mass mobility behavior.",,,,vimeo 230834183,10.1109/TVCG.2016.2616404,2016,2017,VAST,301-C,Tuesday,"Space, Time, Movement",3:00 PM,3:20 PM

Word-scale graphics include both data-driven representations such as word-scale visualizations and sparklines, and non-data-driven visual marks. Their design, function, and use has so far received little research attention. We present the results of an open ended exploratory study with 9 graphic designers. The study resulted in a rich collection of different types of graphics, data provenance, and relationships between text, graphics, and data. Based on this corpus, we present a systematic overview of word-scale graphic designs, and examine how designers used them. We also discuss the designers’ goals in creating their graphics, and characterize how they used word-scale graphics to visualize data, add emphasis, and create alternative narratives. Building on these examples, we discuss implications for the design of authoring tools for word-scale graphics and visualizations, and explore how new authoring environments could make it easier for designers to integrate them into documents",,,,vimeo 230834366,10.1109/TVCG.2016.2618797,2016,2017,InfoVis,301-D,Thursday,Text and Machine Learning,9:10 AM,9:30 AM

TVCG,TVCG,A Systematic Review of Experimental Studies on Data Glyphs,"Johannes Fuchs, Petra Isenberg, Anastasia Bezerianos, Daniel Keim",https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01378429/document,"We systematically reviewed 64 user-study papers on data glyphs to help researchers and practitioners gain an informed understanding of tradeoffs in the glyph design space. The glyphs we consider are individual representations of multi-dimensional data points, often meant to be shown in small-multiple settings. Over the past 60 years many different glyph designs were proposed and many of these designs have been subjected to perceptual or comparative evaluations. Yet, a systematic overview of the types of glyphs and design variations tested, the tasks under which they were analyzed, or even the study goals and results does not yet exist. In this paper we provide such an overview by systematically sampling and tabulating the literature on data glyph studies, listing their designs, questions, data, and tasks. In addition we present a concise overview of the types of glyphs and their design characteristics analyzed by researchers in the past, and a synthesis of the study results.

TVCG,TVCG,Evaluating Cartogram Effectiveness,"Sabrina Nusrat, Muhammad Jawaherul Alam, Stephen Kobourov",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.02218.pdf,"Cartograms are maps in which areas of geographic regions, such as countries and states, appear in proportion to some variable of interest, such as population or income. Cartograms are popular visualizations for geo-referenced data that have been used for over a century to illustrate patterns and trends in the world around us. Despite the popularity of cartograms, and the large number of cartogram types, there are few studies evaluating the effectiveness of cartograms in conveying information. Based on a recent task taxonomy for cartograms, we evaluate four major types of cartograms: contiguous, non-contiguous, rectangular, and Dorling cartograms. We first evaluate the effectiveness of these cartogram types by quantitative performance analysis (time and error). Second, we collect qualitative data with an attitude study and by analyzing subjective preferences. Third, we compare the quantitative and qualitative results with the results of a metrics-based cartogram evaluation. Fourth, we analyze the results of our study in the context of cartography, geography, visual perception, and demography.

In this paper, we present a statistical framework for quantification of uncertainty and its propagation in the main stages of the visualization pipeline. We propose a novel generalization of Irwin-Hall distributions from the statistical viewpoint of splines and box-splines, that enables interpolation of random variables. Moreover, we introduce a probabilistic transfer function classification model that allows for incorporating probability density functions into the volume rendering integral. Our statistical framework allows for incorporating distributions from various sources of uncertainty which makes it suitable in a wide range of visualization applications. We demonstrate effectiveness of our approach in visualization of ensemble data, visualizing large datasets at reduced scale, iso-surface extraction, and visualization of noisy data.",,,,vimeo 230834547,10.1109/TVCG.2016.2637333,2016,2017,SciVis,207,Tuesday,Volume Rendering,4:35 PM,4:55 PM
TVCG,TVCG,The Subspace Voyager: Exploring High-Dimensional Data along a Continuum of Salient 3D Subspaces,"Bing Wang, Klaus Mueller",https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1603/1603.04781.pdf,"Analyzing high-dimensional data and finding hidden patterns is a difficult problem and has attracted numerous research efforts. Automated methods can be useful to some extent but bringing the data analyst into the loop via interactive visual tools can help the discovery process tremendously. An inherent problem in this effort is that humans lack the mental capacity to truly understand spaces exceeding three spatial dimensions. To keep within this limitation, we describe a framework that decomposes a high-dimensional data space into a continuum of generalized 3D subspaces. Analysts can then explore these 3D subspaces individually via the familiar trackball interface while using additional facilities to smoothly transition to adjacent subspaces for expanded space comprehension. Since the number of such subspaces suffers from combinatorial explosion, we provide a set of data-driven subspace selection and navigation tools which can guide users to interesting subspaces and views. A subspace trail map allows users to manage the explored subspaces, keep their bearings, and return to interesting subspaces and views. Both trackball and trail map are each embedded into a word cloud of attribute labels which aid in navigation. We demonstrate our system via several use cases in a diverse set of application areas – cluster analysis and refinement, information discovery, and supervised training of classifiers. We also report on a user study that evaluates the usability of the various interactions our system provides.",,,,youtube c-yKtajfGQE,10.1109/TVCG.2017.2672987,2016,2017,VAST,301-C,Wednesday,High-dimensional Data,9:50 AM,10:10 AM

However, before we can understand what these rankings tell us about the world, we need to be able to more easily create and explore them, given the significant scale of today’s data. In this paper, we describe the computational challenges in building a real-time visual exploratory tool for finding top-ranked objects; build on the recent work involving in-memory and rank-aware data cubes to propose TOPKUBE: a data structure that answers top-k queries up to one order of magnitude faster than the previous state of the art; demonstrate the usefulness of our methods using a set of real-world, publicly available datasets; and provide a new set of benchmarks for other researchers to validate their methods and compare to our own.",,,,,10.1109/TVCG.2017.2671341,2017,2017,InfoVis,301-D,Tuesday,Time and Space,5:35 PM,5:55 PM
TVCG,TVCG,Perceptual Biases in Font Size as a Data Encoding,"Eric Carlson Alexander, Chih-Ching Chang, Mariana Shimabukuro, Steve Franconeri, Christopher Collins, Michael Gleicher",,"Many visualizations, including word clouds, cartographic labels, and word trees, encode data within the sizes of fonts. While font size can be an intuitive dimension for the viewer, using it as an encoding can introduce factors that may bias the perception of the underlying values. Viewers might conflate the size of a word’s font with a word’s length, the number of letters it contains, or with the larger or smaller heights of particular characters (‘o’ vs. ‘p’ vs. ‘b’). We present a collection of empirical studies showing that such factors—which are irrelevant to the encoded values—can indeed influence comparative judgements of font size, though less than conventional wisdom might suggest. We highlight the largest potential biases, and describe a strategy to mitigate them.",,,,vimeo 230834531,10.1109/TVCG.2017.2723397,2017,2017,InfoVis,301-D,Wednesday,Perception,9:10 AM,9:30 AM

The goal of those techniques is to enable users to explore events and interactions over space and time in order to facilitate the discovery of patterns, anomalies and relationships within the data. However, it is difficult to extract and visualize data flow patterns over time for non-directional statistical data without trajectory information. In this work, we develop a novel flow analysis technique to extract, represent, and analyze flow maps of non-directional spatiotemporal data unaccompanied by trajectory information. We estimate a continuous distribution of these events over space and time, and extract flow fields for spatial and temporal changes utilizing a gravity model. Then, we effectively visualize the spatiotemporal patterns in the data by employing flow visualization techniques. The user is presented with temporal trends of geo-referenced discrete events on a map. As such, overall spatiotemporal data flow patterns help users analyze geo-referenced temporal events, such as disease outbreaks, crime patterns, etc. To validate our model, we discard the trajectory information in an origin-destination dataset and apply our technique to the data and compare the derived trajectories and the original. Finally, we present spatiotemporal trend analysis for statistical datasets including twitter data, maritime search and rescue events, and syndromic surveillance",,,,vimeo 230834322,10.1109/TVCG.2017.2666146,2017,2017,VAST,301-C,Tuesday,"Space, Time, Movement",3:20 PM,3:40 PM

Ragan, Alex Endert",http://bahadorsaket.com/publication/encodingsPaper.pdf,"User interfaces for data visualization often consist of two main components: control panels for user interaction and visual representation. A recent trend in visualization is directly embedding user interaction into the visual representations. For example, instead of using control panels to adjust visualization parameters, users can directly adjust basic graphical encodings (e.g., changing distances between points in a scatterplot) to perform similar parameterizations. However, enabling embedded interactions for data visualization requires a strong understanding of how user interactions influence the ability to accurately control and perceive graphical encodings. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of these graphical encodings when serving as the method for interaction. Our user study includes 12 interactive graphical encodings. We discuss the results in terms of task performance and interaction effectiveness metrics.",https://medium.com/@GT_Vis/evaluating-interactive-graphical-encodings-for-data-visualization-b9b8b4bf47f8,https://github.com/gtvalab/interactive-graphical-encodings,https://github.com/gtvalab/interactive-graphical-encodings/tree/master/Supplementary%20Materials/Raw%20Data,vimeo 230834446,10.1109/TVCG.2017.2680452,2017,2017,InfoVis,301-D,Wednesday,Perception,9:50 AM,10:10 AM

Analysis of these data requires tacit knowledge to fill ’gaps’ so that predictions can be made for incomplete data. Through discussions with 30 industry and academic specialists, we identified three analysis use cases that exemplified the limitations of current petrophysics analysis tools. We used those use cases to develop nine core requirements for PETMiner, which is innovative because of its ability to display detailed images of the samples as data points, directly plot multiple sample properties and derived measures for comparison, and substantially reduce interaction cost. An 11-month evaluation demonstrated benefits across all three use cases by allowing a consultant to: (1) generate more accurate reservoir flow models, (2) discover a previously unknown relationship between one easy-to-measure property and another that is costly, and (3) make a 100-fold reduction in the time required to produce plots for a report.",,,,vimeo 230834380,10.1109/TVCG.2017.2682865,2017,2017,SciVis,106-ABC,Friday,Applications and Visual analysis,9:10 AM,9:30 AM
TVCG,TVCG,Indexed-Points Parallel Coordinates Visualization of Multivariate Correlations,"Liang Zhou, Daniel Weiskopf",http://www.cs.utah.edu/~zhoul/Research/mypapers/pflatsInPCP_authors.pdf,"We address the problem of visualizing multivariate correlations in parallel coordinates. We focus on multivariate correlation in the form of linear relationships between multiple variables. Traditional parallel coordinates are well prepared to show negative correlations between two attributes by distinct visual patterns. However, it is difficult to recognize positive correlations in parallel coordinates. Furthermore, there is no support to highlight multivariate correlations in parallel coordinates. In this paper, we exploit the indexed point representation of p-flats (planes in multidimensional data) to visualize local multivariate correlations in parallel coordinates. Our method yields clear visual signatures for negative and positive correlations alike, and it supports large datasets. All information is shown in a unified parallel coordinates framework, which leads to easy and familiar user interactions for analysts who have experience with traditional parallel coordinates.

TVCG,TVCG,A Combined Eulerian-Lagrangian Data Representation for Large-scale Applications,"Franz Sauer, Jinrong Xie, Kwan-Liu Ma",,"The Eulerian and Lagrangian reference frames each provide a unique perspective when studying and visualizing results from scientific systems. As a result, many large-scale simulations produce data in both formats, and analysis tasks that simultaneously utilize information from both representations are becoming increasingly popular. However, due to their fundamentally different nature, drawing correlations between these data formats is a computationally difficult task, especially in a large-scale setting. In this work, we present a new data representation which combines both reference frames into a joint Eulerian-Lagrangian format. By reorganizing Lagrangian information according to the Eulerian simulation grid into a “unit cell” based approach, we can provide an efficient out-of-core means of sampling, querying, and operating with both representations simultaneously. We also extend this design to generate multi-resolution subsets of the full data to suit the viewer’s needs and provide a fast flow-aware trajectory construction scheme.

TVCG,TVCG,Keshif: Rapid and Expressive Tabular Data Exploration for Novices,"Mehmet Adil Yalcin, Niklas Elmqvist, Benjamin B Bederson",http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~elm/projects/keshif/keshif.pdf,"General purpose graphical interfaces for data exploration are typically based on manual visualization and interaction specifications. While designing manual specification can be very expressive, it demands high efforts to make effective decisions, therefore reducing exploratory speed. Instead, principled automated designs can increase exploratory speed, decrease learning efforts, help avoid ineffective decisions, and therefore better support data analytics novices. Towards these goals, we present Keshif, a new systematic design for tabular data exploration. To summarize a given dataset, Keshif aggregates records by value within attribute summaries, and visualizes aggregate characteristics using a consistent design based on data types. To reveal data distribution details, Keshif features three complementary linked selections: highlighting, filtering, and comparison. Keshif further increases expressiveness through aggregate metrics, absolute/part-of scale modes, calculated attributes, and saved selections, all working in synchrony. Its automated design approach also simplifies authoring of dashboards composed of summaries and individual records from raw data using fluid interaction. We show examples selected from 160+ datasets from diverse domains.

In many situations, users find them a flexible method to analyze and interact with data. Unfortunately, using PCPs becomes challenging as the number of data items grows large or multiple trends within the data mix in the visualization. The resulting overdraw can obscure important features. A number of modifications to PCPs have been proposed, including using color, opacity, smooth curves, frequency, density, and animation to mitigate this problem. However, these modified PCPs tend to have their own limitations in the kinds of relationships they emphasize. We propose a new data scalable design for representing and exploring data relationships in PCPs. The approach exploits the point/line duality property of PCPs and a local linear assumption of data to extract and represent relationship summarizations. This approach simultaneously shows relationships in the data and the consistency of those relationships. Our approach supports various visualization tasks, including mixed linear and nonlinear pattern identification, noise detection, and outlier detection, all in large data.

Gap Charts show entries, e. g., teams participating in a competition, that are ranked over time according to a performance metric like a growing number of points or a score. The main advantages of Gap Charts are that 1) tied entries never overlap—only changes in rank generate limited overlap between time-steps; and 2) gaps between entries show the magnitude of their score difference. We evaluate the effectiveness of Gap Charts for performing different types of tasks, and find that they outperform standard time-dependent ranking visualizations for tasks that involve identifying and understanding evolutions in both ranks and scores. Finally, we show that Gap Charts are a generic and scalable class of line charts by applying them to a variety of different datasets.",,,,vimeo 230841502,10.1109/MCG.2016.100,2016,2017,Other,101-ABC,Thursday,Sports Data Visual Analytics,11:10 AM,11:30 AM

However, because glyphs are typically small, they are vulnerable to various perceptual errors. In information theory and communication, the concept of Hamming distance underpins the study of codes that support error detection and correction by the receiver without the need for corroboration from the sender. In this work, we propose the novel concept of quasi-Hamming distance in the context of glyph design. We examine the feasibility of estimating quasi-Hamming distance between a pair of glyphs, and the minimal Hamming distance for a glyph set. This measurement enables glyph designers to determine the differentiability between glyphs, facilitating design optimization by maximizing distances between glyphs under various design constraints. We demonstrate this concept with a case study of visualizing file system events for multiple users. Our evaluation shows that the concept of quasi-Hamming distance facilitates separability in glyph design and helps to reduce the vulnerability of glyph-based visualization.",,,,vimeo 230841589,10.1109/MCG.2016.66,2017,2017,Other,101-ABC,Wednesday,Spatiotemporal Applications,10:50 AM,11:10 AM

This better matches the way people actually make predictions, while the current interfaces can only be filled linearly, with text fields widgets as input. We released a first version of the interface for the 2014 FIFA soccer World Cup that validated the use of direct manipulation as alternative to widgets.

Through a qualitative study we explored whether people apply observable active reading techniques when reading paper-based visualizations. Participants used a range of physical actions while reading, and from these we synthesized an initial set of active reading techniques for visualizations. To learn more about the potential impact such techniques may have on visualization reading, we implemented support for one type of physical action from our observations (making freeform marks) in an interactive graph visualization. Results from our quantitative study of this implementation show that interactive support for active reading techniques can improve the accuracy of performing low-level visualization tasks. Together, our studies suggest that the active reading space is ripe for research exploration within visualization and can lead to new interactions that make for a more flexible and effective visualization reading experience.",,,http://innovis.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/supplemental/Active-Reading-of-Visualizations/#S21,youtube pj0g8_Kcq9A,,2018,2017,InfoVis,301-D,Thursday,Understanding Visualization,2:40 PM,3:00 PM

Through a series of four replications conducted on two crowdsourcing platforms, we investigate an alternative explanation, namely, that the charts allowed participants to better assess the drug’s efficacy. Considered together, our experiments suggest that the chart seems to have indeed promoted understanding, although the effect is likely very small. Meanwhile, we were unable to replicate the original study’s findings, as text with chart appeared to be no more persuasive – and sometimes less persuasive – than text alone. This suggests that the effect may not be as robust as claimed and may need specific conditions to be reproduced. Regardless, within our experimental settings and considering our study as a whole (N = 623), the chart’s contribution to understanding was clearly larger than its contribution to persuasion.",,,http://www.aviz.fr/blinded,vimeo 230841144,10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744298,2018,2017,InfoVis,301-D,Thursday,Understanding Visualization,3:00 PM,3:20 PM
InfoVis,TVCG,Bridging From Goals to Tasks with Design Study Analysis Reports,"Heidi Lam, Melanie Tory, Tamara Munzner",https://research.tableau.com/sites/default/files/GoalsToTasks.pdf,"Visualization researchers and practitioners engaged in generating or evaluating designs are faced with the difficult problem of transforming the questions asked and actions taken by target users from domain-specific language and context into more abstract forms. Existing abstract task classifications aim to provide support for this endeavour by providing a carefully delineated suite of actions. Our experience is that this bottom-up approach is part of the challenge: low-level actions are difficult to interpret without a higher-level context of analysis goals and the analysis process. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework based on analysis reports derived from open-coding 20 design study papers published at IEEE InfoVis 2009-2015, to build on the previous work of abstractions that collectively encompass a broad variety of domains. The framework is organized in two axes illustrated by nine analysis goals. It helps situate the analysis goals by placing each goal under axes of specificity (Explore, Describe, Explain, Confirm) and number of data populations (Single, Multiple). The single-population types are Discover Observation, Describe Observation, Identify Main Cause, and Collect Evidence. The multiple-population types are Compare Entities, Explain Differences, and Evaluate Hypothesis. Each analysis goal is scoped by an input and an output and is characterized by analysis steps reported in the design study papers. We provide examples of how we and others have used the framework in a top-down approach to abstracting domain problems: visualization designers or researchers first identify the analysis goals of each unit of analysis in an analysis stream, and then encode the individual steps using existing task classifications with the context of the goal, the level of specificity, and the number of populations involved in the analysis.",,http://tinyurl.com/gt27fau,,vimeo 230841235,,2018,2017,InfoVis,301-D,Wednesday,Design,11:30 AM,11:50 AM

We first define multi-attribute choice tasks, a type of decision task commonly performed with such visualizations. We then identify which of the existing multidimensional visualizations are compatible with such tasks, and set out to evaluate three elementary visualizations: parallel coordinates, scatterplot matrices and tabular visualizations. Our method consists in first giving participants low-level analytic tasks, in order to ensure that they properly understood the visualizations and their interactions. Participants are then given multi-attribute choice tasks consisting of choosing holiday packages. We assess decision support through multiple objective and subjective metrics, including a decision accuracy metric based on the consistency between the choice made and self-reported preferences for attributes. We found the three visualizations to be comparable on most metrics, with a slight advantage for tabular visualizations. In particular, tabular visualizations allow participants to reach decisions faster. Thus, although decision time is typically not central in assessing decision support, it can be used as a tie-breaker when visualizations achieve similar decision accuracy. Our results also suggest that indirect methods for assessing choice confidence may allow to better distinguish between visualizations than direct ones. We finally discuss the limitations of our methods and directions for future work, such as the need for more sensitive metrics of decision support.",,,,vimeo 230840695,10.1109/TVCG.2017.2745138,2018,2017,InfoVis,301-D,Thursday,Understanding Visualization,2:00 PM,2:20 PM

Such support is difficult to design because solutions must address both the specifics of their scenario as well as the general issues of comparison. This paper aids designers by providing a strategy for considering those general issues. It presents four considerations that abstract comparison. These considerations identify issues and categorize solutions in a domain independent manner. The first considers how the common elements of comparison—a target set of items that are related and an action the user wants to perform on that relationship—are present in an analysis problem. The second considers why these elements lead to challenges because of their scale, in number of items, complexity of items, or complexity of relationship. The third considers what strategies address the identified scaling challenges, grouping solutions into three broad categories. The fourth considers which visual designs map to these strategies to provide solutions for a comparison analysis problem. In sequence, these considerations provide a process for developers to consider support for comparison in the design of visualization tools. Case studies show how these considerations can help in the design and evaluation of visualization solutions for comparison problems.",,,,vimeo 230841111,,2018,2017,InfoVis,301-D,Wednesday,Design,10:50 AM,11:10 AM

Mass cytometry creates a high-dimensional description vector for single cells by time-of-flight measurement. Recently, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding (t-SNE) has emerged as one of the state-of-the-art techniques for the visualization and exploration of single-cell data. Ever increasing amounts of data lead to the adoption of Hierarchical Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding (HSNE), enabling the hierarchical representation of the data. Here, the hierarchy is explored selectively by the analyst, who can request more and more detail in areas of interest. Such hierarchies are usually explored by visualizing disconnected plots of selections in different levels of the hierarchy. This poses problems for navigation, by imposing a high cognitive load on the analyst. In this work, we present an interactive summary-visualization to tackle this problem.

Inspired by recent interactive visualizations that display people’s expectations of data against the data, we conducted a controlled experiment to evaluate the effect of showing social information in the form of other people’s expectations on people’s ability to recall the data, the degree to which they adjust their expectations to align with the data, and their trust in the accuracy of the data. We found that social information that exhibits a high degree of consensus lead participants to recall the data more accurately relative to participants who were exposed to the data alone. Additionally, participants trusted the accuracy of the data less and were more likely to maintain their initial expectations when other people’s expectations aligned with their own initial expectations but not with the data.

We find that having a user graphically predict the possible effects from experiment replications is an effective way to improve one’s ability to make predictions about replications of new experiments.

However, existing visualization design guidelines typically focus on single rather than multiple views. Solely following these guidelines can lead to effective yet inconsistent views (e.g., the same field has different axes domains across charts), making interpretation slow and error-prone. Moreover, little is known how consistency balances with other design considerations, making it difficult to incorporate consistency mechanisms in visualization authoring software. We present a wizard-of-oz study in which we observed how Tableau users achieve and sacrifice consistency in an exploration-to-presentation visualization design scenario. We extend (from our prior work) a set of encoding-specific constraints defining consistency across multiple views. Using the constraints as a checklist in our study, we observed cases where participants spontaneously maintained consistent encodings and warned cases where consistency was overlooked. In response to the warnings, participants either revised views for consistency or stated why they thought consistency should be overwritten. We categorize participants’ actions and responses as constraint validations and exceptions, depicting the relative importance of consistency and other design considerations under various circumstances (e.g., data cardinality, available encoding resources, chart layout).

We further show several use cases of the tool for analyzing specific hidden state properties on datasets containing nesting, phrase structure, and chord progressions, and demonstrate how the tool can be used to isolate patterns for further statistical analysis.",http://lstm.seas.harvard.edu/,https://github.com/HendrikStrobelt/LSTMVis,,vimeo 172145096,,2018,2017,InfoVis,301-D,Thursday,Text and Machine Learning,9:50 AM,10:10 AM
InfoVis,TVCG,Modeling Color Difference for Visualization Design,Danielle Albers Szafir,http://danielleszafir.com/colordiff_vis2017.pdf,"Color is frequently used to encode values in visualizations. For color encodings to be effective, the mapping between colors and values must preserve important differences in the data. However, most guidelines for effective color choice in visualization are based on either color perceptions measured using large, uniform fields in optimal viewing environments or on qualitative intuitions. These limitations may cause data misinterpretation in visualizations, which frequently use small, elongated marks. Our goal is to develop quantitative metrics to help people use color more effectively in visualizations. We present a series of crowdsourced studies measuring color difference perceptions for three common mark types: points, bars, and lines. Our results indicate that peoples’ abilities to perceive color differences varies significantly across mark types. Probabilistic models constructed from the resulting data can provide objective guidance for designers, allowing them to anticipate viewer perceptions in order to inform effective encoding design.",,,,video http://cmci.colorado.edu/visualab/papers/infovis_paper-333.m4v,,2018,2017,Other,301-CD,Tuesday,VIS Awards & Best Papers,9:25 AM,9:45 AM

We map existing research related to brushing and linking into a design space that deconstructs the interaction technique into three components: source (what is being brushed), link (the expression of relationship between source and target), and target (what is revealed as related to the source). Using this design space, we created MyBrush, a unified interface that offers personal agency over brushing and linking by giving people the flexibility to configure the source, link, and target of multiple brushes. The results of three focus groups demonstrate that people with different backgrounds leveraged personal agency in different ways, including performing complex tasks and showing links explicitly. We reflect on these results, paving the way for future research on the role of personal agency in information visualization.",http://innovis.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/supplemental/MyBrush/demo/,https://github.com/philippkoytek/mybrush,,youtube 1iAtPhWEV9I,,2018,2017,InfoVis,301-D,Tuesday,Techniques,2:20 PM,2:40 PM

Only recently have other forms of interaction begun to appear, such as natural language or touch-based interaction, though usually operating only independently. Prior evaluations of natural language interfaces for visualization have indicated potential value in combining direct manipulation and natural language as complementary interaction techniques. We hypothesize that truly multimodal interfaces for visualization, those providing users with freedom of expression via both natural language and touch-based direct manipulation input, may provide an effective and engaging user experience. Unfortunately, however, little work has been done in exploring such multimodal visualization interfaces. To address this gap, we have created an architecture and a prototype visualization system called Orko that facilitates both natural language and direct manipulation input. Specifically, Orko focuses on the domain of network visualization, one that has largely relied on WIMP-based interfaces and direct manipulation interaction, and has little or no prior research exploring natural language interaction. We report results from an initial evaluation study of Orko, and use our observations to discuss opportunities and challenges for future work in multimodal network visualization interfaces.",,,,vimeo 230840776,,2018,2017,InfoVis,301-D,Thursday,Graphs and Paths,5:15 PM,5:35 PM

This is achieved by reformulating the stress function to impose constraints on both the edge vectors and lengths instead of just on the edge lengths (node distances). This is a unified framework for both constrained and unconstrained graph visualizations, where we can model most existing layout constraints, as well as develop new ones such as the star shapes and cluster separation constraints within stress majorization. This improvement also allows us to parallelize computation with an efficient GPU conjugant gradient solver, which yields fast and stable solutions, even for large graphs.

In this paper, we help designers in making design choices for scatterplot visualizations. We survey the literature to catalog scatterplot-specific analysis tasks. We look at how data characteristics influence design decisions. We then survey scatterplot-like designs to understand the range of design options. Building upon these three organizations, we connect data characteristics, analysis tasks, and design choices in order to generate challenges, open questions, and example best practices for the effective design of scatterplots",,,,video https://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/Papers/2018/SG18/scatterplot-paper-ff.mp4,,2018,2017,InfoVis,301-D,Wednesday,Design,10:30 AM,10:50 AM

Scatterplot diagnostics (scagnostics) approaches measure characteristics of scatterplots to automatically find potentially interesting plots, thereby making SPLOMs more scalable with the dimension count. While statistical measures such as regression lines can capture orientation, and graph-theoretic scagnostics measures can capture shape, there is no scatterplot characterization measure that uses both descriptors. Based on well-known results in shape analysis, we propose a scagnostics approach that captures both scatterplot shape and orientation using skeletons (or medial axes). Our representation can handle complex spatial distributions, helps discovery of principal trends in a multiscale way, scales visually well with the number of samples, is robust to noise, and is automatic and fast to compute. We define skeleton-based similarity metrics for the visual exploration and analysis of SPLOMs. We perform a user study to measure the human perception of scatterplot similarity and compare the outcome to our results as well as to graph-based scagnostics and other visual quality metrics. Our skeleton-based metrics outperform previously defined measures both in terms of closeness to perceptually-based similarity and computation time efficiency.",,,,vimeo 230841215,,2018,2017,InfoVis,301-D,Wednesday,Multidimensional Data,2:20 PM,2:40 PM

While their creation is supported by many mature methods and tools, surprisingly little are suited for the needs of information visualization. In this article, we introduce a novel approach to creating visualizations mock-ups, based on a dialogue between graphic design and parametric toolkit explorations. Our approach consists in iteratively subdividing the display space, while progressively informing each division with realistic data. We show that a wealth of mock-ups can easily be created using only temporary data attributes, as we wait for more realistic data to become available. We describe the implementation of this approach in a D3-based toolkit, which we use to highlight its generative power, and we discuss the potential for transitioning towards higher fidelity prototypes",,https://github.com/romsson/d3-gridding,,vimeo 230840552,,2018,2017,InfoVis,301-D,Wednesday,Design,11:10 AM,11:30 AM

Over time, tables can undergo changes in both structure and content, which results in multiple versions of the same table. A challenging task when working with such derived tables is to understand what exactly has changed between versions in terms of additions/deletions, reorder, merge/split, and content changes. For textual data, a variety of commonplace ""diff"" tools exist that support the task of investigating changes between revisions of a text. Although there are some comparison tools which assist users in inspecting differences between multiple table instances, the resulting visualizations are often difficult to interpret or do not scale to large tables with thousands of rows and columns. To address these challenges, we developed TACO, an interactive comparison tool that visualizes effectively the differences between multiple tables at various levels of detail. With TACO we show (1) the aggregated differences between multiple table versions over time, (2) the aggregated changes between two selected table versions, and (3) detailed changes between the selection.

Our environments differ in how they exploit natural human perception and interaction capabilities. We compare an augmented-reality head-mounted display (Microsoft HoloLens), a handheld tablet, and a desktop setup. The novel head-mounted HoloLens display projects stereoscopic images of virtual content into a user’s real world and allows for interaction in-situ at the spatial position of the 3D hologram. The tablet is able to interact with 3D content through touch, spatial positioning, and tangible markers, however, 3D content is still presented on a 2D surface. Our hypothesis is that visualization environments that match human perceptual and interaction capabilities better to the task at hand improve understanding of 3D visualizations. To better understand the space of display and interaction modalities in visualization environments, we first propose a classification based on three dimensions: perception, interaction, and the spatial and cognitive proximity of the two. Each technique in our study is located at a different position along these three dimensions. We asked 15 participants to perform four tasks, each task having different levels of difficulty for both spatial perception and degrees of freedom for interaction.

However, despite their widespread application, little is known about the structure and properties of these spaces. To gain insights into the relationship between words, the NLP community has begun to adapt high-dimensional visualization techniques. In particular, researchers commonly use t-distributed stochastic neighbor embeddings (t-SNE) and principal component analysis (PCA) to create two-dimensional embeddings for assessing the overall structure and exploring linear relationships (e.g., word analogies), respectively. Unfortunately, these techniques often produce mediocre or even misleading results and cannot address domain-specific visualization challenges that are crucial for understanding semantic relationships in word embeddings. Here, we introduce new embedding techniques for visualizing semantic and syntactic analogies, and the corresponding tests to determine whether the resulting views capture salient structures. Additionally, we introduce two novel views for a comprehensive study of analogy relationships.

A nonlinear narrative is a storytelling device that portrays events of a story out of chronological order, e.g., in reverse order or going back and forth between past and future events. Many acclaimed movies employ unique narrative patterns which in turn have inspired other movies and contributed to the broader analysis of narrative patterns in movies. However, understanding and communicating nonlinear narratives is a difficult task due to complex temporal disruptions in the order of events as well as no explicit records specifying the actual temporal order of the underlying story. Story curves visualize the nonlinear narrative of a movie by showing the order in which events are told in the movie and comparing them to their actual chronological order, resulting in possibly meandering visual patterns in the curve. We also present Story Explorer, an interactive tool that visualizes a story curve together with complementary information such as characters and settings. Story Explorer further provides a script curation interface that allows users to specify the chronological order of events in movies. We used Story Explorer to analyze 10 popular nonlinear movies and describe the spectrum of narrative patterns that we discovered, including some novel patterns not previously described in the literature.

Selecting a “good” layout method is thus important for visualizing a graph. The selection can be highly subjective and dependent on the given task. A common approach to selecting a good layout is to use aesthetic criteria and visual inspection. However, fully calculating various layouts and their associated aesthetic metrics is computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to large graph visualization based on computing the topological similarity of graphs using graph kernels. For a given graph, our approach can show what the graph would look like in different layouts and estimate their corresponding aesthetic metrics. An important contribution of our work is the development of a new framework to design graph kernels. Our experimental study shows that our estimation calculation is considerably faster than computing the actual layouts and their aesthetic metrics. Also, our graph kernels outperform the state-of-the-art ones in both time and accuracy. In addition, we conducted a user study to demonstrate that the topological similarity computed with our graph kernel matches perceptual similarity assessed by human users.",http://graphvis.net/wgl,,,vimeo 230840405,,2018,2017,InfoVis,301-D,Thursday,Graphs and Paths,4:15 PM,4:35 PM

A blue-noise polyline sampling scheme is then introduced to select time series samples, which can both preserve outliers and reduce visual clutter. To further investigate the root cause of a failed training process, we propose a credit assignment algorithm that indicates how other neurons contribute to the output of the neuron causing the training failure.

BiDots overcomes several limitations of existing bicluster visualizations by encoding biclusters in a more compact and cluster-driven manner. A set of handy interactions is incorporated to support flexible analysis of biclustering results. More importantly, BiDots addresses the cases of weighted biclusters, which has been underexploited in the literature.

Existing distance functions assess the similarity between trajectories based on properties of the trajectory points or segments. The properties may include the spatial positions, times, and thematic attributes. There may be a need to focus the analysis on certain parts of trajectories, i.e., points and segments that have particular properties. According to the analysis focus, the analyst may need to cluster trajectories by similarity of their relevant parts only. Throughout the analysis process, the focus may change, and different parts of trajectories may become relevant. We propose an analytical workflow in which interactive filtering tools are used to attach relevance flags to elements of trajectories, clustering is done using a distance function that ignores irrelevant elements, and the resulting clusters are summarized for further analysis.

Both fields provide a broad set of labeling strategies, whereby machine learning (and in particular active learning) follows a rather model-centered approach and visual analytics employs rather user-centered approaches (visual-interactive labeling). Both approaches have individual strengths and weaknesses. In this work, we conduct an experiment with three parts to assess and compare the performance of these different labeling strategies. In our study, we (1) identify different visual labeling strategies for user-centered labeling, (2) investigate strengths and weaknesses of labeling strategies for different labeling tasks and task complexities, and (3) shed light on the effect of using different visual encodings to guide the visual-interactive labeling process. We further compare labeling of single versus multiple instances at a time, and quantify the impact on efficiency. We systematically compare the performance of visual interactive labeling with that of active learning. Our main findings are that visual-interactive labeling can outperform active learning, given the condition that dimension reduction separates well the class distributions. Moreover, using dimension reduction in combination with additional visual encodings that expose the internal state of the learning model turns out to improve the performance of visual-interactive labeling.",,,,video http://homepage.univie.ac.at/michael.sedlmair/papers/bernard2017labeling.mp4,,2018,2017,VAST,301-C,Thursday,Interaction in the Analysis Process,2:20 PM,2:40 PM

Advances in word embedding allow building such concepts from a small set of seed terms. However, naive application of such techniques may result in false positive errors because of the polysemy of human language. To mitigate this problem, we present a visual analytics system called ConceptVector that guides the user in building such concepts and then using them to analyze documents. Document-analysis case studies with real-world datasets demonstrate the fine-grained analysis provided by ConceptVector. To support the elaborate modeling of concepts using user seed terms, we introduce a bipolar concept model and support for irrelevant words. We validate the interactive lexicon building interface via a user study and expert reviews.

Compared to traditional classifiers, where features are handcrafted, neural networks learn increasingly complex features directly from the data. Instead of handcrafting the features, it is now the network architecture that is manually engineered. The network architecture parameters such as the number of layers or the number of filters per layer and their interconnections are essential for good performance. Even though basic design guidelines exist, designing a neural network is an iterative trial-and-error process that takes days or even weeks to perform due to the large datasets used for training. In this paper, we present DeepEyes, a Progressive Visual Analytics system that supports the design of neural networks during training. We present novel visualizations, supporting the identification of layers that learned a stable set of patterns and, therefore, are of interest for a detailed analysis.

With a growing number of classes, the accuracy usually drops as the possibilities of confusion increase. Interestingly, the class confusion patterns follow a hierarchical structure over the classes. We present visual-analytics methods to reveal and analyze this hierarchy of similar classes in relation with CNN-internal data. We found that this hierarchy not only dictates the confusion patterns between the classes, it furthermore dictates the learning behavior of CNNs. In particular, the early layers in these networks develop feature detectors that can separate high-level groups of classes quite well, even after a few training epochs. In contrast, the latter layers require substantially more epochs to develop specialized feature detectors that can separate individual classes. We demonstrate how these insights are key to significant improvement in accuracy by designing hierarchy-aware CNNs that accelerate model convergence and alleviate overfitting.

Our technique visualizes the dynamics of these rules as they evolve over time.  Using the data produced byKaSim, an open source stochastic simulator of rule-based models written in theKappalanguage, DINs provide a node-link diagramthat represents the influence that each rule has on the other rules. That is, rather than representing individual biological components ortypes, we instead represent the rules about them (as nodes) and the current influence of these rules (as links). Using our interactiveDIN-Vizsoftware tool, researchers are able to query this dynamic network to find meaningful patterns about biological processes, andto identify salient aspects of complex rule-based models.

Analyzing collections of event sequences can reveal common or semantically important sequential patterns. For example, event sequence analysis might reveal frequently used care plans for treating a disease, typical publishing patterns of professors, and the patterns of service that result in a well-maintained car. It is challenging, however, to visually explore large numbers of event sequences, or sequences with large numbers of event types. Existing methods focus on extracting explicitly matching patterns of events using statistical analysis to create stages of event progression over time. However, these methods fail to capture latent clusters of similar but not identical evolutions of event sequences. In this paper, we introduce a novel visualization system named EventThread which clusters event sequences into threads based on tensor analysis and visualizes the latent stage categories and evolution patterns by interactively grouping the threads by similarity into time-specific clusters.

While several existing tools allow users to visualize pre-defined networks, creating these networks from raw data remains a challenging task, often requiring users to program custom scripts or write complex SQL commands. Some existing tools also allow users to both visualize and model networks. Interaction techniques adopted by these tools often assume users know the exact conditions for defining edges in the resulting networks. This assumption may not always hold true, however. In cases where users do not know much about attributes in the dataset or when there are several attributes to choose from, users may not know which attributes they could use to formulate linking conditions. We propose an alternate interaction technique to model networks that allows users to demonstrate to the system a subset of nodes and links they wish to see in the resulting network. The system, in response, recommends conditions that can be used to model networks based on the specified nodes and links. In this paper, we show how such a demonstration-based interaction technique can be used to model networks by employing it in a prototype tool, Graphiti. Through multiple usage scenarios, we show how Graphiti not only allows users to model networks from a tabular dataset but also facilitates updating a pre-defined network with additional edge types.",,,,vimeo 230830104,,2018,2017,VAST,301-C,Tuesday,Graphs and Trees,5:35 PM,5:55 PM

This yields a trial-and-error process to verify the appropriate model and parameters. This paper contributes an exploratory interface that supports visual identification of low-dimensional structures in a high-dimensional dataset, and facilitates the optimized selection of data models and configurations. Our key idea is to abstract a set of global and local feature descriptors from the neighborhood graph-based representation of the latent low-dimensional structure, such as pairwise geodesic distance (GD) among points and pairwise local tangent space divergence (LTSD) among pointwise local tangent spaces (LTS). We propose a new LTSD-GD view, which is constructed by mapping LTSD and GD to the x axis and y axis using 1D multidimensional scaling, respectively. Unlike traditional dimensionality reduction methods that preserve various kinds of distances among points, the LTSD-GD view presents the distribution of pointwise LTS (x axis) and the variation of LTS in structures (the combination of x axis and y axis).

Brown, Alex Endert",https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~ewall9/media/papers/PodiumVAST17.pdf,"People often rank and order data points as a vital part of making decisions. Multi-attribute ranking systems are a common tool used to make these data-driven decisions. Such systems often take the form of a table-based visualization in which users assign weights to the attributes representing the quantifiable importance of each attribute to a decision, which the system then uses to compute a ranking of the data. However, these systems assume that users are able to quantify their conceptual understanding of how important particular attributes are to a decision. This is not always easy or even possible for users to do. Rather, people often have a more holistic understanding of the data. They form opinions that data point A is better than data point B but do not necessarily know which attributes are important. To address these challenges, we present a visual analytic application to help people rank multi-variate data points. We developed a prototype system, Podium, that allows users to drag rows in the table to rank order data points based on their perception of the relative value of the data. Podium then infers a weighting model using Ranking SVM that satisfies the user’s data preferences as closely as possible. Whereas past systems help users understand the relationships between data points based on changes to attribute weights, our approach helps users to understand the attributes that might inform their understanding of the data. We present two usage scenarios to describe some of the potential uses of our proposed technique: (1) understanding which attributes contribute to a user’s subjective preferences for data, and (2) deconstructing attributes of importance for existing rankings.Our proposed approach makes powerful machine learning techniques more usable to those who may not have expertise in these areas",,,,youtube Z4N9wKxK2i4,,2018,2017,VAST,301-C,Thursday,Interaction in the Analysis Process,2:00 PM,2:20 PM

The main contribution of our work is an iterative decision-making technique in which users provide a document-based relevance feedback that allows the framework to converge to a user-endorsed topic distribution.

The method addresses a fundamental trade-off in visualization design: reducing visual clutter vs. increasing the information content in a visualization. The method enables simultaneous sequence clustering and pattern extraction and is highly tolerant to noises such as missing or additional events in the data. Based on this approach we propose a visual analytics framework with multiple levels-of-detail to facilitate interactive data exploration.

However, users are still required to interpret and compare these superior items manually before making a successful choice. This task is challenging because of two issues. First, people usually have fuzzy, unstable, and inconsistent preferences when presented with multiple candidates. Second, skyline queries do not reveal the reasons for the superiority of certain skyline points in a multi-dimensional space.

In practice, however, many problems cannot be solved completely automatically, but require a &#x201C;human-in-the-loop&#x201D; to iteratively refine the model and give hints to the solver. In this paper, we explore the parallels between this interactive optimisation workflow and the visual analytics sense-making loop. We assert that interactive optimisation is essentially a visual analytics task and propose a problem-solving loop analogous to the sense-making loop. We explore these ideas through an in-depth analysis of a use-case in prostate brachytherapy, an application where interactive optimisation may be able to provide significant assistance to practitioners in creating prostate cancer treatment plans customised to each patient&#x0027;s tumour characteristics. However, current brachytherapy treatment planning is usually a careful, mostly manual process involving multiple professionals.

Identified clusters (i.e., groups of similar members), however, can be very sensitive to small changes of the selected region, so that clustering results can be misleading and bias subsequent analyses. In this article, we –a team of visualization scientists and meteorologists– deliver visual analytics solutions to analyze the sensitivity of clustering results with respect to changes of a selected region. We propose an interactive visual interface that enables simultaneous visualization of a) the variation in composition of identified clusters (i.e., their robustness), b) the variability in cluster membership for individual ensemble members, and c) the uncertainty in the spatial locations of identified trends. We demonstrate that our solution shows meteorologists how representative a clustering result is, and with respect to which changes in the selected region it becomes unstable. Furthermore, our solution helps to identify those ensemble members which stably belong to a given cluster and can thus be considered similar. In a real-world application case we show how our approach is used to analyze the clustering behavior of different regions in a forecast of “Tropical Cyclone Karl”, guiding the user towards the cluster robustness information required for subsequent ensemble analysis",,,,vimeo 230830865,,2018,2017,VAST,301-C,Thursday,ML2: Cluster Analysis,4:15 PM,4:35 PM

To this end, we propose a visual analytics workflow to help data scientists and domain experts explore, diagnose, and understand the decisions made by a binary classifier. The approach leverages “instance-level explanations”, measures of local feature relevance that explain single instances, and uses them to build a set of visual representations that guide the users in their investigation. The workflow is based on three main visual representations and steps: one based on aggregate statistics to see how data distributes across correct / incorrect decisions; one based on explanations to understand which features are used to make these decisions; and one based on raw data, to derive insights on potential root causes for the observed patterns. The workflow is derived from a long-term collaboration with a group of machine learning and healthcare professionals who used our method to make sense of machine learning models they developed. The case study from this collaboration demonstrates that the proposed workflow helps experts derive useful knowledge about the model and the phenomena it describes, thus experts can generate useful hypotheses on how a model can be improved.",,https://github.com/nyuvis/explanation_explorer,,vimeo 235631465,,2017,2017,VAST,102-ABC,Friday,ML3: Classification,9:10 AM,9:30 AM

Our computational methods integrate seven different measures to identify and characterize future events, leveraging information regarding time, location, social networks, and the informativeness of the messages. A visual interface is tightly coupled with the computational methods to present a concise summary of the possible future events.

Existing techniques allow to visualize and compare patterns in subspaces. However, many subspace analysis methods produce an abundant amount of patterns, which often remain redundant and are difficult to relate. Creating effective layouts for comparison of subspace patterns remains challenging. We introduce Pattern Trails, a novel approach for visually ordering and comparing subspace patterns. Central to our approach is the notion of pattern transitions as an interpretable structure imposed to order and compare patterns between subspaces. The basic idea is to visualize projections of subspaces side-by-side, and indicate changes between adjacent patterns in the subspaces by a linked representation, hence introducing pattern transitions. Our contributions comprise a systematization for how pairs of subspace patterns can be compared, and how changes can be interpreted in terms of pattern transitions. We also contribute a technique for visual subspace analysis based on a data-driven similarity measure between subspace representations. This measure is useful to order the patterns, and interactively group subspaces to reduce redundancy. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by application to several use cases, indicating that data can be meaningfully ordered and interpreted in terms of pattern transitions.",,,,vimeo 230829949,,2017,2017,VAST,301-C,Wednesday,High-dimensional Data,8:50 AM,9:10 AM

In this paper, we tackle the challenges of evaluation analysis in the domain of question-answering (QA) systems. Through in-depth studies with QA researchers, we identify tasks and goals of evaluation analysis and derive a set of design rationales, based on which we propose a novel approach termed prismatic analysis. Prismatic analysis examines data through multiple ways of categorization (referred as angles). Categories in each angle are measured by aggregate metrics to enable diverse comparison scenarios.<br/>To facilitate prismatic analysis of QA evaluations, we design and implement the Question Space Anglyzer (QSAnglyzer), a visual analytics (VA) tool. In QSAnglyzer, the high-dimensional space formed by questions is divided into categories based on several angles (e.g., topic and question type). Each category is aggregated by accuracy, the number of questions, and accuracy variance across evaluations. QSAnglyzer visualizes these angles so that QA researchers can examine and compare evaluations from various aspects both individually and collectively. Furthermore, QA researchers filter questions based on any angle by clicking to construct complex queries. We validate QSAnglyzer through controlled experiments and by expert reviews. The results indicate that when using QSAnglyzer, users perform analysis tasks faster (p < 0.01) and more accurately (p < 0.05), and are quick to gain new insight.

In this paper, we present a novel, systematic study and resulting analyses that investigate the effects of anchoring effect on human decision-making using visual analytic systems. Visual analytics interfaces typically contain multiple views that present various aspects of information such as spatial, temporal, and categorical. These views are designed to present complex, heterogeneous data in accessible forms that aid decisionmaking. However, human decision-making is often hindered by the use of heuristics, or cognitive biases, such as anchoring effect. Anchoring effect can be triggered by the order in which information is presented or the magnitude of information presented. Through carefully designed laboratory experiments, we present evidence of anchoring effect in analysis with visual analytics interfaces when users are primed by representation of different pieces of information. We also describe detailed analyses of users’ interaction logs which reveal the impact of anchoring bias on the visual representation preferred and paths of analysis. We discuss implications for future research to possibly detect and alleviate anchoring bias.",,,https://github.com/wesslen/vast2017-anchoringeffect,vimeo 230830292,,2017,2017,VAST,301-C,Thursday,Theory and Analysis Process,11:30 AM,11:50 AM

Additionally, this important class of VA environments has never been elaborated on by existing work on VA theory.

It is because causal inference algorithms by themselves typically cannot encode an adequate amount of domain knowledge to break all ties. Visual analytic approaches are considered a feasible alternative to fully automated methods. However, their application in real-world scenarios can be tedious. This paper focuses on these practical aspects of visual causality analysis. The most imperative of these aspects is posed by Simpson’ Paradox. It implies the existence of multiple causal models differing in both structure and parameter depending on how the data is subdivided. We propose a comprehensive interface that engages human experts in identifying these subdivisions and allowing them to establish the corresponding causal models via a rich set of interactive facilities. Other features of our interface include: (1) a new causal network visualization that emphasizes the flow of causal dependencies, (2) a model scoring mechanism with visual hints for interactive model refinement, and (3) flexible approaches for handling heterogeneous data.

Astrocytes are glial cells, i.e., non-neuronal cells that support neurons and the nervous system. The study of astrocytes has immense potential for understanding brain function. However, their complex and widely-branching structure requires high-resolution electron microscopy imaging and makes visualization and analysis challenging. Furthermore, the structure and function of astrocytes is very different from neurons, and therefore requires the development of new visualization and analysis tools. With Abstractocyte, biologists can explore the morphology of astrocytes using various visual abstraction levels, while simultaneously analyzing neighboring neurons and their connectivity. We define a novel, conceptual 2D abstraction space for jointly visualizing astrocytes and neurons. Neuroscientists can choose a specific joint visualization as a point in this space. Interactively moving this point allows them to smoothly transition between different abstraction levels in an intuitive manner. In contrast to simply switching between different visualizations, this preserves the visual context and correlations throughout the transition. Users can smoothly navigate from concrete, highly-detailed 3D views to simplified and abstracted 2D views. In addition to investigating astrocytes, neurons, and their relationships, we enable the interactive analysis of the distribution of glycogen, which is of high importance to neuroscientists.

Our approach allows them to deal with the increasingly complex DNA objects that they are designing, to improve their features, and to add novel functions in a way that no existing single-scale approach offers today. For this purpose we collaborated with DNA nanotechnology experts to design a set of ten semantic scales. These scales take the DNA’s chemical and structural behavior into account and depict it from atoms to the targeted architecture with increasing levels of abstraction. To create coherence between the discrete scales, we seamlessly transition between them in a well-defined manner. We use special encodings to allow experts to estimate the nanoscale object’s stability. We also add scale-adaptive interactions that facilitate the intuitive modification of complex structures at multiple scales.

SciVis,TVCG,Robust detection and visualization of jet-stream core lines in atmospheric flow,"Michael Kern, Tim Hewson, Filip Sadlo, Rüdiger Westermann, Marc Rautenhaus",,"Jet-streams, their core lines and their role in atmospheric dynamics have been subject to considerable meteorological research since the first half of the twentieth century. Yet, until today no consistent automated feature detection approach has been proposed to identify jet-stream core lines from 3D wind fields. Such 3D core lines can facilitate meteorological analyses previously not possible. Although jet-stream cores can be manually analyzed by meteorologists in 2D as height ridges in the wind speed field, to the best of our knowledge no automated ridge detection approach has been applied to jet-stream core detection. In this work, we –a team of visualization scientists and meteorologists– propose a method that exploits directional information in the wind field to extract core lines in a robust and numerically less involved manner than traditional 3D ridge detection. For the first time, we apply the extracted 3D core lines to meteorological analysis, considering real-world case studies and demonstrating our method’s benefits for weather forecasting and meteorological research.",,,,vimeo 230835424,,2018,2017,SciVis,207,Wednesday,Flow Visualization,8:30 AM,8:50 AM
SciVis,TVCG,Screen-Space Normal Distribution Function Caching for Consistent Multi-Resolution Rendering of Large Particle Data,"Mohamed Ibrahim, Patrick Wickenhäuser, Peter Rautek, Guido Reina, Markus Hadwiger",http://vccvisualization.org/publications/2017_ibrahim_SNDF.pdf,"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are crucial to investigating important processes in physics and thermodynamics. The simulated atoms are usually visualized as hard spheres with Phong shading, where individual particles and their local density can be perceived well in close-up views. However, for large-scale simulations with 10 million particles or more, the visualization of large fields-of-view usually suffers from strong aliasing artifacts, because the mismatch between data size and output resolution leads to severe under-sampling of the geometry. Excessive super-sampling can alleviate this problem, but is prohibitively expensive. This paper presents a novel visualization method for large-scale particle data that addresses aliasing while enabling interactive high-quality rendering. We introduce the novel concept of screen-space normal distribution functions (S-NDFs) for particle data. S-NDFs represent the distribution of surface normals that map to a given pixel in screen space, which enables high-quality re-lighting without re-rendering particles. In order to facilitate interactive zooming, we cache S-NDFs in a screen-space mipmap (S-MIP). Together, these two concepts enable interactive, scale-consistent re-lighting and shading changes, as well as zooming, without having to re-sample the particle data. We show how our method facilitates the interactive exploration of real-world large-scale MD simulation data in different scenarios.",,,,video http://vccvisualization.org/publications/2017_ibrahim_SNDF.mp4,10.1109/TVCG.2017.2743979,2018,2017,SciVis,207,Tuesday,"Mix: Foundations, uncertainty, particles",3:00 PM,3:20 PM
SciVis,TVCG,SparseLeap: Efficient Empty Space Skipping for Large-Scale Volume Rendering,"Markus Hadwiger, Ali K. Al-Awami, Johanna Beyer, Marco Agus, Hanspeter Pfister",https://johanna-b.github.io/files/documents/sparseleap_vis17.pdf,"Recent advances in data acquisition produce volume data of very high resolution and large size, such as terabyte-sized microscopy volumes. These data often contain many fine and intricate structures, which pose huge challenges for volume rendering, and make it particularly important to efficiently skip empty space. This paper addresses two major challenges: (1) The complexity of large volumes containing fine structures often leads to highly fragmented space subdivisions that make empty regions hard to skip efficiently. (2) The classification of space into empty and non-empty regions changes frequently, because the user or the evaluation of an interactive query activate a different set of objects, which makes it unfeasible to pre-compute a well-adapted space subdivision. We describe the novel SparseLeap method for efficient empty space skipping in very large volumes, even around fine structures. The main performance characteristic of SparseLeap is that it moves the major cost of empty space skipping out of the ray-casting stage. We achieve this via a hybrid strategy that balances the computational load between determining empty ray segments in a rasterization (object-order) stage, and sampling non-empty volume data in the ray-casting (image-order) stage. Before ray-casting, we exploit the fast hardware rasterization of GPUs to create a ray segment list for each pixel, which identifies non-empty regions along the ray. The ray-casting stage then leaps over empty space without hierarchy traversal. Ray segment lists are created by rasterizing a set of fine-grained, view-independent bounding boxes. Frame coherence is exploited by re-using the same bounding boxes unless the set of active objects changes. We show that SparseLeap scales better to large, sparse data than standard octree empty space skipping.",,,,vimeo 230835661,,2018,2017,SciVis,207,Tuesday,Volume Rendering,4:55 PM,5:15 PM

SciVis,TVCG,The Topology ToolKit,"Julien Tierny, Guillaume Favelier, Joshua Levine, Charles Gueunet, Michaël Michaux",https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01499905/document,"This system paper presents the Topology ToolKit (TTK), a software platform designed for the topological analysis of scalar data in scientific visualization. While topological data analysis has gained in popularity over the last two decades, it has not yet been widely adopted as a standard data analysis tool for end users or developers. TTK aims at addressing this problem by providing a unified, generic, efficient, and robust implementation of key algorithms for the topological analysis of scalar data, including: critical points, integral lines, persistence diagrams, persistence curves, merge trees, contour trees, Morse-Smale complexes, fiber surfaces, continuous scatterplots, Jacobi sets, Reeb spaces, and more. TTK is easily accessible to end users due to a tight integration with ParaView. It is also easily accessible to developers through a variety of bindings (Python, VTK/C++) for fast prototyping or through direct, dependency-free, C++, to ease integration into pre-existing complex systems. While developing TTK, we faced several algorithmic and software engineering challenges, which we document in this paper. In particular, we present an algorithm for the construction of a discrete gradient that complies to the critical points extracted in the piecewise-linear setting. This algorithm guarantees a combinatorial consistency across the topological abstractions supported by TTK, and importantly, a unified implementation of topological data simplification for multi-scale exploration and analysis. We also present a cached triangulation data structure, that supports time efficient and generic traversals, which self-adjusts its memory usage on demand for input simplicial meshes and which implicitly emulates a triangulation for regular grids with no memory overhead. Finally, we describe an original software architecture, which guarantees memory efficient and direct accesses to TTK features, while still allowing for researchers powerful and easy bindings and extensions. TTK is open source (BSD license) and its code, online documentation and video tutorials are available on TTK’s website [108].",https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/,https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk,,youtube Hn8w0V-jHgw,,2018,2017,SciVis,207,Wednesday,Topology-based methods,2:40 PM,3:00 PM

The inherent noise in the CT scan coupled with the often disconnected (and sometimes broken) skeletal structure of fishes makes an automatic segmentation of the volume impractical. To overcome this, our framework combines techniques from computational topology with an interactive visual interface, enabling the human-in-the-loop to effectively extract fishes from the volume. In the first step, the join tree of the input is used to create a hierarchical segmentation of the volume. Through the use of linked views, the visual interface then allows users to interactively explore this hierarchy, and gather parts of individual fishes into a coherent sub-volume, thus reconstructing entire fishes. Our framework was primarily developed for its application to CT scans of fishes, generated as part of the ScanAllFish project, through close collaboration with their lead scientist. However, we expect it to also be applicable in other biological applications where a single data set contains multiple specimen; a common routine that is now widely followed in laboratories to increase throughput of expensive CT scanners.",,,,youtube gz22DjMRJjk,,2018,2017,SciVis,207,Wednesday,Topology-based methods,2:00 PM,2:20 PM

Eduard Gröller, Ivan Viola",https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2017/mindek-2017-marion/mindek-2017-marion-Paper.pdf,"We propose a system to facilitate biology communication by developing a pipeline to support the instructional visualization of heterogeneous biological data on heterogeneous user-devices. Discoveries and concepts in biology are typically summarized with illustrations assembled manually from the interpretation and application of heterogenous data. The creation of such illustrations is time consuming, which makes it incompatible with frequent updates to the measured data as new discoveries are made. Illustrations are typically non-interactive, and when an illustration is updated, it still has to reach the user. Our system is designed to overcome these three obstacles. It supports the integration of heterogeneous datasets, reflecting the knowledge that is gained from different data sources in biology. After pre-processing the datasets, the system transforms them into visual representations as inspired by scientific illustrations. As opposed to traditional scientific illustration these representations are generated in real-time - they are interactive. The code generating the visualizations can be embedded in various software environments. To demonstrate this, we implemented both a desktop application and a remote-rendering server in which the pipeline is embedded. The remote-rendering server supports multi-threaded rendering and it is able to handle multiple users simultaneously. This scalability to different hardware environments, including multi-GPU setups, makes our system useful for efficient public dissemination of biological discoveries.",,,,video https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2017/mindek-2017-marion/mindek-2017-marion-Preview.avi,,2018,2017,SciVis,207,Thursday,Visualization in Biology and Medicine,9:30 AM,9:50 AM
